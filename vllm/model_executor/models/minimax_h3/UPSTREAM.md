# Native MiniMax H3 provenance

The numerical model and media helpers are adapted from Apache-2.0 licensed

Comfy checkpoint handling is informed by vLLM-Omni PR #6894 at

The initial scope excluded LoRA. Native LightX2V Turbo support now follows the
artifact contracts in Omni `b58ff5cb8b17250b76f9cdf9b9b46385cdda4376`
(`diffusion/models/minimax_h3/lora.py`, unchanged from the initial port's
reference). Native execution uses registered, staged A/B buffers and H3 SM70
GEMMs instead of Omni's generic LoRA manager. FlashGen's native grouped-QKV
layout and metadata schedule follow `diffusion/models/minimax_h3/npu/lora.py`
at the initial pinned Omni revision. The export is device-independent; native
execution uses the same SM70 staged delta path. The pruned INT8 integration
restores original dense AdaLN/time tensors, preserving backbone INT8 data.
FastH3 Dense mapping and fusion follow `diffusion/models/minimax_h3/fasth3.py`
at the initial pinned Omni revision. Original weights are fused before native
TP loading and staging. Native VSA now follows the same revision's
`attention/backends/fastvideo_vsa.py` geometry and learned compression, with a
true SM70 block-sparse CUTLASS kernel. All three VSA adapter identities and
complete gate inventories are validated. Native INT8 fusion remains unsupported;
full VSA sampling quality and performance acceptance are still pending.
Approximate diffusion caches, step batching, Ulysses/Ring parallelism and other
model families remain outside this implementation. Model weights and checkpoint
remote code retain their respective upstream terms; they are not vendored here.
