## Scope and frozen contract

This work admits the fully quantized
`QUASAR-QAT/Qwen3.8-27B-QUASAR-NVFP4` checkpoint on four V100 GPUs without
narrowing DFlash2 to `max_num_seqs=1`, a 512-token prefill budget, or one target
KV dtype. The measured practical contract is TP4, FP16 execution, Flash-V100,
FP8 E5M2 target KV, FP16 draft KV, prefix caching, Mamba alignment, a 256K
declared context, `max_num_batched_tokens=4096`, `max_num_seqs=4`, seven model
drafts, selector top-16, probabilistic draft sampling, and full target/draft
CUDA graphs. The final wheel gate measures cold prefill only through 64K, as
required by the release test plan.

The checkpoint differs materially from the earlier mixed NVFP4 baseline. All
attention, GDN, and MLP linears are checkpoint-native NVFP4. On Volta, the
accepted QPN2 and TurboMind kernels execute those weights as W4A16: they retain
the checkpoint's FP4 weights and group scales but consume FP16 activations.
They do not emulate the checkpoint's W4A4 activation quantizer. This is an
existing SM70 execution contract, not a property of speculative decoding, and
is why dataset scores rather than route logs are a mandatory release gate.

## Correctness root cause

The initial target-only smoke for `17 + 25` emitted a long run of `!`. A real
checkpoint oracle covered all six TP-local projection shapes. Five shapes
matched a dense dequantized-weight reference, while the GDN fused input
projection did not:

| Projection | TP-local shape | Old result |
|---|---:|---:|
| GDN `in_proj_qkvz` | K=5120, N=4120 | relative L2 about 0.5 |
| GDN output | K=1536, N=5120 | within FP16 tolerance |
| attention QKV | K=5120, N=3584 | within FP16 tolerance |
| attention output | K=1536, N=5120 | within FP16 tolerance |
| MLP gate/up | K=5120, N=8704 | within FP16 tolerance |
| MLP down | K=4352, N=5120 | within FP16 tolerance |

N=4120 is divisible by eight but not by the TurboMind converter's required
16-column physical layout. The converter silently produced corrupt values.
Padding weights and scales with zero rows to N=4128, executing the physical
shape, and cropping before bias reduced relative L2 to about `3e-4` with cosine
similarity rounding to 1.0 on every TP rank. The exact arithmetic smoke then
returned `42`.

The implementation records logical and physical output widths in the prepared
linear state, uses the physical width for warmup and execution, and crops to
the logical width before bias, reshape, or a row-parallel collective consumes
the result. Padded fused gate-SiLU remains rejected because no current model
needs that unsupported layout.

## QPN2 all-projection verification path

The same real-weight oracle was extended to the six QUASAR projection shapes
at M=1 and M=8 on all four TP shards. QPN2 passed every cell. In the final M=8
run, the worst observed relative L2 was `5.20e-4`; cosine similarity was at
least `0.99999988`. Depending on the projection and TP shard, QPN2 was
`1.29x--3.94x` faster than the corrected TurboMind path. The N=4120 GDN fused
input projection used a physical N=4128 buffer on all four ranks. A forced
M=16 run separately covered the ephemeral dense-prefill algorithm; its output
differed from the established TurboMind reference by at most one FP16 ULP.
M=16 timing is deliberately not a production claim because the actual
large-M threshold is 1024.

The runtime admission is intentionally exact: compressed-tensors NVFP4,
recognized Qwen3.8 TP4 projection suffix and packed shape, DFlash block 8,
selector top-16, PP1, and no DBO. It does not require one resident sequence,
E5M2 target KV, or a particular prefill chunk. Unsupported shapes retain the
corrected TurboMind path.

A production-shape Split-K/accumulator sweep found only about 0.15 ms of
additional whole-model opportunity. That reduction-order change is not being
promoted: the practical round is already below the target and preserving the
current quality candidate is more valuable than a marginal timing claim.

## Scheduler and prefill isolation

MRV2 DFlash owns a separate K+1 query batch. Its K mask slots must size the
draft `InputBuffers`, hidden-state buffer, context-position buffer, and
per-group slot mappings; they must not be subtracted from the target
scheduler's prefill budget. A target-only scheduled-token property now returns
zero extra target slots for `method=dflash` while retaining the old accounting
for Eagle, MTP, and `dflash_ddtree`.

The DFlash speculator independently raises draft buffer capacity to at least
`max_num_seqs * (draft_block + 1)`. Its runtime and captured CUDA graph also
use a DFlash-owned persistent slot-mapping buffer rather than borrowing the
target `BlockTables` allocation. This closes the out-of-bounds case where
`max_num_seqs * 8` exceeds `max_num_batched_tokens`. The SM70 interactivity
defaults no longer force `max_num_seqs=1` or
`max_num_batched_tokens=4096`; normal server defaults and every explicit user
override survive.

With prefix caching and Mamba alignment enabled, two cold token-ID repetitions
measured 4,138/4,155 token/s at 32K and 3,612/3,607 token/s at 63,488 tokens.
A later cold chat-contract confirmation, with a marker before the repeated
body to prevent accidental cross-case prefix reuse, measured:

| Prompt | Prefill throughput |
|---:|---:|
| 32,724 tokens | 4,049 token/s |
| 63,482 tokens | 3,607 token/s |

These are slightly above the same-machine mixed-NVFP4 DFlash2 history of about
4,039 and 3,567 token/s, so enabling DFlash2 no longer removes the accepted
large-M QPN2-packed prefill path.

## Complete-round evidence

Graph-node tracing is diagnostic overhead, not a release timing. Under the
same Nsight instrumentation, the old mixed target and QUASAR all-QPN2 target
had nearly identical stable target-replay intervals (about 21.31 and 21.16 ms)
and rank-max GPU service (about 19.39 and 19.19 ms). This establishes that the
additional checkpoint-native NVFP4 projections are no longer an unexplained
gap.

The profiler-free practical service then ran five identical, warmed,
single-request measurements on the final candidate:

`17.543, 17.545, 17.517, 17.624, 17.532 ms/round`

The mean is `17.552 ms`, with a `17.517--17.624 ms` range. The requested
sub-20-ms gate therefore passes without binding server capacity to B1.

## Quality gates

The following gates were applied before packaging:

1. target-only and DFlash2 use the same QUASAR checkpoint, sampling contract,
   dataset order, seed policy, 16K output cap, practical cache settings, and
   score harness;
2. executable MBPP with long xhigh reasoning and token-level WikiText
   likelihood must not show a meaningful loss versus target-only;
3. BFCL-style simple, multiple, parallel, and irrelevance cases plus strict
   JSON Schema cases must be compared with the target-only service;
4. prefix-hit follow-ups and mixed-length batch 1/2/4 runs must show no stale
   GDN state, KV corruption, graph residue, or memory growth;
5. the DFlash2 seven-position acceptance vector must be reported in full.

Target-only and DFlash both pass six of eight fixed BFCL cases. Both misses are
the same two parallel fixtures, where each arm emits one valid call instead of
the fixture's expected two calls; simple, multiple, and irrelevance cases all
pass. Target-only passes all four fixed JSON Schema cases at a 2K budget.
DFlash passes three at 2K; the remaining complex schema consumes the 2K budget
in valid reasoning and emits no content, then passes and stops naturally at
2,655 tokens with a 4K budget. This is a budget-sensitive reasoning trajectory,
not malformed JSON or a speculative-decoding protocol error.

The first matched MBPP-32 run uses temperature 1.0, top-p 0.95, top-k 20,
`xhigh` reasoning, request seed 0, and a 16K natural-EOS cap. Target-only
passes 32/32 independent tests; accelerated DFlash2 passes 31/32. EvalPlus
excludes the one row without an independent contract and scores target-only
versus DFlash2 Base `31/31` versus `30/31` and Plus `29/31` versus `27/31`.
The only base discordance is one valid but incorrectly terminating comb-sort
implementation. With one discordant pair, the exact McNemar p-value is 1.0;
this run is evidence to investigate rather than evidence of a population
regression.

A full same-seed QPN2 rollback arm isolates the newly widened target operator
from the rest of DFlash2. It also scores 31/32, EvalPlus Base 30/31, and Plus
27/31, but fails a different row after a 16K reasoning-length termination.
Thus disabling QPN2 does not recover aggregate quality. It reduces mean steady
decode from 251.93 to 225.44 token/s and aggregate output throughput from
228.75 to 208.06 token/s. Disabling QPN2 therefore does not repair the sampled
failure but costs about 11.8% steady decode throughput.

At request seed `20260925`, target-only and all-QPN2 DFlash2 both score MBPP
32/32, EvalPlus Base 31/31, and Plus 28/31, with identical Plus failure rows.
Across the two predeclared seeds, target-only scores Base 62/62 and Plus 57/62;
DFlash scores Base 61/62 and Plus 55/62. There is only one paired discordance
for each score class, which is not significant evidence of a population
regression. The second seed's exact score and failure agreement also rejects
the hypothesis that QPN2 systematically degrades code quality.

On eight matched 2,048-token WikiText prompts, target-only and DFlash emit the
same first output token and text in every case. The maximum prompt PPL
difference is `0.00851`; the maximum per-token prompt/output log-probability
difference is `0.938/0.190`, within the predeclared model-quality bounds of
`1.0/0.25/0.01` for prompt logprob, output logprob, and PPL.

Structured-output batch gates pass target-only and DFlash at B1/B2/B4
(`42/42` each). The final DFlash protocol suite passes tool-chain 6/6, nested
and escaped JSON schemas, and stream/non-stream parity 3/3. Explicit-history
Responses replay passes; server-side Responses storage remains disabled
because the current store has no eviction policy and is not required for tool
calling. Prefix-state follow-ups pass 5/5 with and without thinking for both
arms.

A 96-request mixed B4 structured-output stress passes 96/96. V100 memory is
28,855 MiB per rank before and after the run; the subsequent first long-prefill
allocation leaves only a stable 4 MiB one-time increase. Logs contain no OOM,
illegal access, traceback, stale-buffer symptom, or graph replay corruption.

The earlier gross repeated-punctuation failure is closed by the N=4120
physical-layout repair. No quality conclusion is inferred from that smoke or
from greedy token equality.

## Rollback and diagnostics

- `VLLM_SM70_NVFP4_QPN2=0` retains corrected TurboMind execution.
- `VLLM_SM70_NVFP4_QPN2_PREFILL=0` retains the established large-M fallback.
- `VLLM_SM70_DFLASH2_VERIFY_FASTPATH=0` remains a diagnostic rollback, not a
  production quality workaround.
- Missing QPN2 operators or an unrecognized shape fall back explicitly; no
  padded logical width may silently reach a converter that cannot represent
  it.

The real-checkpoint oracle is
`benchmarks/kernels/benchmark_sm70_quasar_nvfp4_oracle.py`. The serving-quality
reporter now discovers every speculative position dynamically instead of
truncating DFlash2 at four positions. Long quality runs also retain each
completed response in an fsync'd partial JSONL sidecar before final summary
metadata is assembled.

## Fresh 1.5.0 wheel release proof

The CPython 3.12 SM70 wheel is
`1cat_vllm-1.5.0-cp312-cp312-linux_x86_64.whl`, size `147,980,225` bytes,
SHA256 `2a4d6bee4e19d315b142f2c563059f3064ddeeca563a6bdc828c33e1073c825b`.
It was built with the CUDA 12.8 toolkit and version metadata `1.5.0`. All ten
native libraries have empty RPATH/RUNPATH and resolve their Torch/CUDA
dependencies with the normal runtime library set. The wheel retains the
release dependency bound
`prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator>=8.1.0,<9.0.0`.

On the four-V100 host, the prior environment was cloned to a distinct Conda
prefix, the old package was uninstalled, and this wheel was installed without
dependencies or a source/PYTHONPATH overlay. `pip check` passes after satisfying
the package's existing `setuptools>=77.0.3,<81.0.0` bound, and `vllm.__file__`
resolves inside the new prefix. The core extension, QPN2 operators, SM70
compact sampler, Flash-V100, and FlashQLA all load from that prefix.

The source-independent TP4 server used FP16 execution, a 262,144-token declared
context, E5M2 target KV, automatic FP16 draft KV, prefix caching with Mamba
alignment, `max_num_batched_tokens=4096`, `max_num_seqs=4`, tool/reasoning
parsers, and target plus draft CUDA graphs. No private fast-path environment
variables were supplied. Startup logs automatically enabled the quality-audited
DFlash2 defaults, loaded all checkpoint-native NVFP4 projections, selected
QPN2 for compatible decode projections and QPN2-packed ephemeral prefill for
M>=1024, and activated the exact q8 grouped verifier.

The final targeted CPU contract suite passes 159 tests under the wheel's
Torch 2.10/CUDA 12.8 ABI. Ruff lint, Ruff format, and `git diff --check` pass
for every changed Python source and test file.

The first 1K request against an empty Triton cache compiled seven bounded
request-shape kernels and measured `23.055 ms/round`. With the cache warm, four
identical requests measured `17.641`, `17.663`, `17.638`, and `17.637`
ms/round: mean `17.645 ms`, range `17.637--17.663 ms`. The first and steady
runs had the same 512 output tokens, 203 draft rounds, and `2.522` emitted
tokens per round; the cold-only difference is compilation latency rather than
an acceptance or execution-route change.

Unique cold long-context requests measured:

| Prompt | Prefill | Complete round | Pure decode | Emitted/round |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 32,724 tokens | 4,038.5 token/s | 18.827 ms | 134.9 token/s | 2.540 |
| 63,482 tokens | 3,596.5 token/s | 20.358 ms | 105.7 token/s | 2.186 |

Both requests contained the required suffix marker, had no replacement
characters, and passed repetition/output-health checks. Their prefill rates are
within about 0.3% of the accepted source measurements, so the wheel does not
lose the promoted prefill path. These ordinary technical-writing prompts have
lower acceptance than the historical easy prompt; complete-round latency, not
their task-dependent decode throughput, is the release comparison.

Two identical 9,994-token prefix requests returned the same healthy output.
Wall time fell from `2.624 s` cold to `0.311 s` cached and TTFT from `2.506 s`
to `0.210 s`; the server recorded 9,888 cached prompt tokens. A four-way
concurrent strict-JSON test passed 16/16 requests. Per-rank GPU memory changed
by at most 2 MiB, and the log contained no traceback, OOM, illegal access,
assertion failure, stale-buffer symptom, or graph corruption. Graceful shutdown
returned GPUs 0--3 to 6 MiB each.

Fresh-wheel protocol probes returned `42.0`, emitted the requested
`get_weather({"city":"Guangzhou"})` call, and produced a schema-valid
`{"name":"小林","age":27}` object. The full client also passed the six-step
tool chain, nested/escaped structured output, stream/non-stream parity, and
explicit-history Responses replay. Its aggregate flag remains false only for
`previous_response_id`: server-side Responses storage is intentionally disabled
because the current store has no eviction policy. The first stored response is
valid and the expected follow-up receives HTTP 404; ordinary Chat Completions
tool calling and explicit-history Responses are unaffected.

## 2026-09-03 concurrency operator campaign

This campaign extends the q7 DFlash2 verifier contract to B2/B4/B8 without
presenting operator projections as endpoint throughput. The fully QUASAR
checkpoint is not available on this host, so the NVFP4 MLP race uses real
layer-55 TP4 weights from the local mixed checkpoint; the three remaining
QUASAR projection shapes use deterministic native-E2M1 tensors. All timings
are CUDA-graph medians on one V100-SXM2-32GB with Torch 2.10/CUDA 12.8.

The QPN2 kernel now tiles verifier rows in independent eight-row CTAs. The
per-row reduction order is unchanged. Across all 64 MLP projections, 16 full
attention projections, and 48 GDN projections, the weighted operator saving
versus TurboMind is `3.115 ms` at M=16 and `2.430 ms` at M=32. M=64 is a
`4.601 ms` regression, so opaque production dispatch admits only M<=32 and
retains TurboMind for B8/M=64. Every measured output is finite; QPN2-versus-
FP32 relative L2 is `3.3e-4--5.5e-4` with cosine approximately one.

The Flash-V100 grouped verifier now accepts request-major q8 batches while
preserving the existing single-request q8/q16 and sparse-page4 paths. B2/B4/B8
interleaved and non-interleaved KV outputs are bitwise equal to concatenated
single-request calls, and a captured B4 graph remains bitwise equal while each
request's runtime sequence length changes. The graph timings are:

| Context | Batch | Grouped | Independent XQA | Speedup |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1,024 | 2 | 0.0739 ms | 0.0571 ms | 0.77x |
| 1,024 | 4 | 0.0353 ms | 0.1058 ms | 3.00x |
| 1,024 | 8 | 0.0680 ms | 0.2188 ms | 3.22x |
| 16,384 | 2 | 0.1362 ms | 0.7056 ms | 5.18x |
| 16,384 | 4 | 0.2530 ms | 1.3867 ms | 5.48x |
| 16,384 | 8 | 0.4975 ms | 2.7351 ms | 5.50x |

The B2/1K loss prevents unconditional promotion. Batched grouped verification
therefore remains behind the default-off
`VLLM_FLASH_V100_DFLASH2_BATCHED_GROUPED_VERIFY` switch until an endpoint run
can establish an actual-length admission policy. The compact target-rejection
path is also still opt-in, but its Python gate now accepts uniform decode-only
B2/B4/B8 batches. Against dense top-k/top-p plus rejection, compact p50 time is
`0.1290/0.0604/0.1300 ms` versus `0.5437/0.9810/1.2360 ms`, respectively. All
24 B2/B4/B8 combinations of q3/q7, top-p 1.0/0.95, and temperature 0.6/1.0
produce the exact same valid tokens and accepted lengths as dense rejection.

Before either opt-in becomes a default, run a matched TP4 endpoint matrix with
the fully QUASAR checkpoint and report pure decode separately from prefill and
TTFT. The required rows are B1/B2/B4/B8 at the same prompt/output lengths,
sampling seed policy, q7 draft, FP8 target KV, FP16 draft KV, attention backend,
and CUDA-graph state.

### Mixed-checkpoint endpoint scaling probe

A follow-up endpoint probe used the locally complete mixed-NVFP4 target because
the fully QUASAR checkpoint is still absent. The contract was TP4 on four
V100-SXM2-32GB GPUs, the official BF16 LM head, q7 probabilistic DFlash2, FP8
E5M2 target KV, FP16 draft KV, Flash-V100 target and draft attention,
FULL_AND_PIECEWISE CUDA Graphs, official temperature 1.0/top-p 0.95/top-k 20
sampling, sixteen fixed low-entropy SPEED-Bench 1K prompts, and 512 output
tokens per request. Batch-specific sampling shapes were warmed before the
reported B2/B4/B8 rows. The B1 row came from the same source, model, sampling,
and graph contract in the immediately preceding service boot.

| Concurrency | Output token/s | Versus B1 | Ideal scaling efficiency | p50 TTFT | p50 TPOT | Mean accepted length |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 187.77 | 1.000x | 100.0% | 318.83 ms | 4.67 ms | 4.16 |
| 2 | 175.26 | 0.933x | 46.7% | 393.04 ms | 10.33 ms | 4.33 |
| 4 | 247.13 | 1.316x | 32.9% | 457.74 ms | 14.28 ms | 4.32 |
| 8 | 362.53 | 1.931x | 24.1% | 1147.63 ms | 18.62 ms | 4.49 |

B2 is a real negative scaling point: steady aggregate output throughput is
6.7% below B1. B4 is 31.6% above B1 and 41.0% above B2. B8 is 93.1% above B1
and 46.7% above B4, but still only 24.1% efficient relative to ideal linear
scaling. The earlier 1K operator result already showed that grouped B2 is
slower than independent XQA, but this endpoint matrix does not isolate that
operator from all other batch-dependent work. A matched grouped-verifier-off
arm is therefore required before changing the admission policy.

The first formal B2 attempt measured only 139.26 output token/s because its
first batch triggered a target-sampling Triton JIT and p99 TTFT reached
11.46 seconds. It is retained as a cold-shape observation, not a steady
baseline. The repeated row above measured 175.26 token/s with p99 TTFT
0.73 seconds. Future concurrency harnesses must warm at least two output steps
for every measured batch shape; a one-token prefix warmup does not compile the
steady sampling path.

The nominal prefix-warm pass queried the exact same input-length sequence, but
Prometheus recorded zero prefix-cache hits in every speed row. These numbers
are consequently 1K-input plus 512-output endpoint measurements, not pure
decode measurements. The source overlay also lacked the optional
`_vllm_fa2_C` exact D256 prefill operators and logged the slower prefill
fallback. Neither caveat invalidates the decode concurrency route hit, but
both prevent using this table as a final prefill or TTFT baseline.

Runtime audit records show FULL target and DFlash CUDA Graph dispatch at
B2/q8=16 tokens, B4/q8=32 tokens, and B8/q8=64 tokens on every TP rank. Worker
logs also confirm QPN2 M<=32, FlashQLA GDN decode, FP8 E5M2 KV decode, compact
target rejection, and the request-major B8 grouped verifier. All four official
sampling rows completed 16/16 requests with zero errors, zero empty outputs,
and the requested 512 tokens. Sampled text is not byte-identical across
concurrency. A separate greedy B1/B8 smoke was byte-identical for 2/8 prompts;
the other six followed different but coherent trajectories, with 8/8 requests
complete and no runtime corruption signal. This is a text-health pass, not a
semantic-quality equivalence claim; normal benchmark quality gates remain
required before either concurrency switch is promoted.

### M16/M32 channel-FP8 concurrency optimization

The explicit scaling targets use the steady B1 result above as the denominator:
B2 must reach `300.43 token/s` (80%), B4 `525.76 token/s` (70%), and B8
`901.30 token/s` (60%). The work below remains a mixed-checkpoint optimization
screen; it does not close the unavailable fully-QUASAR quality gate.

The old channel-FP8 path reconstructs a complete FP16 weight before every
M>8 GEMM. A default-off QPN8 candidate now handles M=9--16 with two 8-row
tiles, and a separate M=17--32 dense candidate executes the original logical
split-K ranges in two ordered phases. The M32 design reduces static reduction
storage from the naive 64 KiB to 28/36 KiB for split-12/16 and streams each
packed weight tile once across all 32 rows. Admission is restricted to the
five measured Qwen3.8 TP4 channel-FP8 shapes. The controls are
`VLLM_SM70_FP8_QPN8_M16`, `VLLM_SM70_FP8_QPN8_M32_CHUNKED`, and
`VLLM_SM70_FP8_QPN8_M32_NATIVE`; all default to off.

Actual-checkpoint operator tests show that M16 reduces the weighted QPN8
projection bucket from `20.276` to `6.959 ms` per target round. At M32, native
dense graph timings are `82.68 us` for GDN input, `27.38 us` for output,
`81.86 us` for full-attention QKV, and `73.71 us` for down projection. Across
M=17/18/24/31/32, every production split is bitwise equal to concatenated M8
calls with maximum difference zero; CUDA Graph replay is also stable. The
retained operator artifacts are `.artifacts/runtime/qpn8-m32-native-dense-r2.json`
and `.artifacts/runtime/qpn8-m32-native-dense-tails-r1.json`.

Same-contract endpoint results are:

| Candidate | B2 token/s | B2 efficiency | B4 token/s | B4 efficiency |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| steady baseline | 175.26 | 46.7% | 247.13 | 32.9% |
| exact M16 + chunked M32 | 253.95 | 67.6% | 309.06 | 41.2% |
| exact M16 + native dense M32 | - | - | 322.68 | 43.0% |

The exact B2 candidate improves the old B2 row by 44.9%; native M32 improves
the old B4 row by 30.6%. All reported rows completed 16/16 requests, generated
the requested 512 tokens, and contained no empty output or replacement
character. B2 acceptance was `47.62%` with mean accepted length `4.33`; B4
native acceptance was `51.68%` with mean length `4.62`. These are output-health
and distribution-correction checks, not a semantic benchmark. Raw endpoint
artifacts are under `.artifacts/runtime/endpoint-qpn8-m16-m32-exact-b2-b4-v1`
and `.artifacts/runtime/endpoint-qpn8-m32-native-b4-v1`.

Three experiments were rejected:

- Moving channel scale to the epilogue and changing split configurations made
  M16 faster, but B4/B8 acceptance length fell by about 8%/10%; it is not the
  retained quality-first implementation.
- Draft proposal temperature scale `0.85` measured B2 `258.38 token/s` and B4
  `313.46 token/s`; it did not improve native-M32 B4 and remains off.
- A bitwise-exact native M64 kernel looked positive with warm operator caches,
  but the endpoint fell to `283.94 token/s`, 21.7% below the steady B8 baseline.
  It was removed. The retained negative artifact is
  `.artifacts/runtime/endpoint-qpn8-m64-native-b8-v1`.

The gates remain open. Native M32 leaves B4 at about 43% efficiency, and B8
still needs a structural change rather than more row tiling. At observed
accepted lengths, the remaining gap cannot be closed by selector or epilogue
micro-tuning alone. The next measurement should split the unprofiled native
candidate into target forward, target logits/rejection, draft, and host
bookkeeping, then evaluate multi-stream or request partitioning inside the
same TP4 instance. Two Nsight Systems runs were attempted, but CUPTI crashed
during multiprocess shutdown before writing a report; do not repeat that
capture path unchanged.

The built-in CUDA-event profiler initially produced no output because the MRV2
gate admitted `mtp` only, while this service resolves the same diagnostic path
with `method=dflash`. The default-off profiler now admits `mtp`, `dflash`, and
`dspark`, matching the legacy runner. A short B2/B4 diagnostic then completed.
The profiler synchronizes every round, so its endpoint throughput is not a
performance result; use only the per-phase CUDA-event split. Median stable
full-batch intervals were:

| Batch | Target forward | Target sample + state | Draft | Total GPU |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| B2 / M16 | 37.64 ms | 1.29 ms | 7.50 ms | 46.65 ms |
| B4 / M32 | 47.41 ms | 1.54 ms | 9.05 ms | 58.10 ms |

Target forward is about 81% of the measured GPU interval in both rows and
accounts for nearly all B2-to-B4 growth. Rejection/sampling is only about
1.3--1.5 ms, which rules out more selector micro-tuning as the primary scaling
project. The diagnostic artifact is
`.artifacts/runtime/endpoint-qpn8-mrv2-profile-b2-b4-v1`.

A q3 B8 screen tested whether shrinking the verifier from M64 to M32 could
avoid the remaining large-batch fallback. It reached only `249.14 token/s`
with `72.85%` draft acceptance and `3.19` emitted tokens per round, versus the
q7 steady B8 result of `362.53 token/s` and mean accepted length `4.49`. The
31.3% throughput loss rejects q3 despite its higher per-position acceptance;
the shorter proposal cannot amortize the target round. The artifact is
`.artifacts/runtime/endpoint-qpn8-q3-b8-screen-v2`.

The historical B4 trace also attributed `5.31 ms` and about 133 launches per
round to TP all-reduce. The accepted M8 push collective handled only the
80-KiB `[8,5120]` payload. A default-off
`VLLM_SM70_TP4_PUSH_ALLREDUCE_CONCURRENCY` candidate expands its IPC slot and
uses a grid-stride loop for M16/M32 without changing rank-ordered FP32
accumulation. Across 128 consecutive collectives per CUDA Graph replay and
four input patterns, every rank is bitwise equal to the current custom-order
reference. Per-collective medians are:

| Payload | Current pull | Push candidate | Saving |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| M16 / 160 KiB | 18.45 us | 11.03 us | 40.2% |
| M32 / 320 KiB | 26.78 us | 18.36 us | 31.5% |

M64 measured `34.08 us` versus `30.79 us` current and was removed from the
admission set. The retained operator artifacts are
`.artifacts/runtime/tp4-push-concurrency-control-r1.json` and
`.artifacts/runtime/tp4-push-concurrency-final-r1.json`.

With exact QPN8 and the push candidate together, the endpoint measured B2
`258.04 token/s` (68.7% efficiency) and B4 `317.11 token/s` (42.2%). B2 is
1.6% above the prior exact-M16 row. B4 raw throughput is below the prior
`322.68 token/s`, while mean emitted tokens per round also moved from `4.62`
to `4.39`; throughput divided by that acceptance length improves by about
3.4%, consistent with the operator saving but not enough to claim an absolute
B4 endpoint win. Both rows completed 16/16 requests at 512 output tokens with
no errors or invalid text. The switch remains default-off and the scaling
gates remain open. Raw results are in
`.artifacts/runtime/endpoint-qpn8-push-ar-b2-b4-v1`.

A third Nsight Systems attempt changed capture termination from
`stop-shutdown` to `stop`, completed the B4 workload, and still crashed in
`cuptiActivityFlushAll` while exiting without generating a report. CUPTI is
therefore unsuitable for this process topology until the external tool/runtime
issue changes; do not spend another run on capture-end variations.

The synchronized MRV2 profiler was then extended to the official q7 B8/M64
shape. Across 43 stable full-batch rounds, median target forward was
`54.103 ms`, target sampling `1.980 ms`, state update `0.044 ms`, draft
`12.041 ms`, and total GPU interval `68.290 ms`. Target forward therefore
accounts for 79.2% of the interval, draft 17.6%, and sampling plus state only
3.0%. The profiler's synchronized `262.45 token/s` endpoint result is not a
speed measurement. The retained phase records are in
`.artifacts/runtime/endpoint-qpn8-mrv2-profile-b8-v1`; they confirm that target
forward, rather than selector or host bookkeeping, remains the B8 bottleneck.

For B2/M16, the NVFP4 QPN2 MLP path previously issued two independent M8
kernels and loaded the same packed weights twice. A default-off
`VLLM_SM70_NVFP4_QPN2_M16_NATIVE` candidate assigns both eight-row groups to
one CTA, reuses each packed weight tile, and preserves the existing split-K
and FP32 reduction order. On real layer-55 TP4-rank-0 weights, gate/up improves
from `72.30` to `66.76 us` and down projection from `38.06` to `31.31 us`, a
weighted `0.786 ms` saving per target round. M9, M15, and M16 outputs are
bitwise equal to concatenated M8 calls for both projections with maximum
difference zero. The operator artifacts are
`.artifacts/runtime/qpn2-m16-native-real-final-r2.json` and
`.artifacts/runtime/qpn2-m16-native-tails-m9-r1.json` /
`.artifacts/runtime/qpn2-m16-native-tails-m15-r1.json`.

With exact QPN8, TP4 push all-reduce, and native NVFP4 QPN2 M16 enabled, two
same-contract TP4/B2 endpoint runs measured `271.46` and `270.20 token/s`.
The final source-matched row is `270.20 token/s`, or 72.0% ideal scaling from
the fixed `187.77 token/s` B1 denominator. It completed 16/16 requests and all
8,192 requested output tokens, with no request errors, empty strings, or
replacement characters. Draft acceptance was `45.30%` and mean accepted
length `4.17`. The final artifact is
`.artifacts/runtime/endpoint-qpn2-m16-native-b2-final-v1` and records extension
SHA256 `10440281536d1364a2faa3b6c71129189aa1ccd6ee91aec598477a7d7d2b35f7`.

Three additional branches were rejected. A bitwise-exact M32 NVFP4 two-row
CTA was slower than the retained path, including down projection
`140.94 us` versus approximately `71.59 us`, and was removed. A q5 TP4/B8
endpoint screen reached only `335.71 token/s`, 7.4% below q7, because mean
emission fell to `3.93` tokens per round despite `58.58%` acceptance. A
single-accumulator channel-FP8 QPN8 M16 variant reached `274.28 token/s` in
one B2 sample, but acceptance-normalized round rate was about 0.6% worse and
the altered reduction order weakened its quality contract; that source was
also removed.

The B2/B4/B8 gates remain open at `300.43/525.76/901.30 token/s`. B2 is now
about 10.1% below its gate, while the retained B4 and B8 rows remain
`322.68/362.53 token/s`. Generic vLLM DBO is not directly applicable: it
targets DP+EP/DeepEP, is unsupported by ModelRunnerV2, and the present service
is dense TP4/DP1. The next structural branch must therefore stay within the
single TP4 instance and prototype MRV2-local two-way verifier microbatching or
request partitioning, with target arithmetic and output quality held fixed.
