# Layer weight offload for capacity-limited H3 execution

The original model's attention/MLP FP16 matrices alone occupy 40,076,574,720
bytes globally. A 32-GB V100 cannot hold that complete DiT, even before FP32
protected weights and activations. The explicit `--weight-offload layer`
deployment option stages individual DiT blocks and Qwen text/vision layers.
`H3Config(weight_offload="layer")` is the Python equivalent. The default
remains whole-component staging for the existing TP4 execution path.

The plan partitions the existing immutable host snapshot by actual storage
ownership. Private block storage moves to the GPU before its forward and is
released afterwards. Storage shared with other blocks or outer consumers stays
resident for the component context, preserving offsets, strides and aliases.
The first DiT block's normalization and AdaLN projection stay resident because
cache decision probes may call them outside the block's forward. Adapter
buffers follow their owning block. No weight precision or reduction changes.

Both normal and failed forwards release block storage. The context removes its
hooks on exit, rejects overlapping use and prevents a whole-component load
during layer staging. GPU copy streams/events are reused sequentially from the
original snapshot; block boundaries synchronize. Allocator retention stays
bounded. This mode does not support a fixed persistent FP16 weight-cache list.

All transfers inside sampling remain in the full denoise denominator.
`dit_layer_weight_staging` / `dit_layer_weight_offload` and the corresponding
encoder fields are host boundary measurements, not isolated GPU transfer
durations. Loading includes host submission and any blocking copies; offload
waits for pending H2D and compute before releasing storage, with no D2H copy.
DiT loading also includes the initial resident setup outside denoise. These
fields must not be summed again into request latency. This is a capacity option,
not an automatic or >80-TFLOP/s configuration.

## Development validation

Python 3.12.13, Torch 2.10.0+cu128, CUDA 12.8.93, V100 SXM2 32GB.
Evidence: `/data/minimax-h3/sm70-general-20260909/`.

- `layer-staging-cpu-v1.log`: 22 ownership, lifetime, failure cleanup,
  configuration and service checks pass, three GPU cases deselected.
- `layer-staging-gpu-v1.log`: FP16 and FP32 models with column-major weights,
  adapter buffers, cross-component aliases and 65-row tails reproduce
  whole-resident results bitwise across three load/forward/offload cycles.

`layer-staging-cpu-v2.log` additionally passes 35 checks, including explicit
resident consumers and both CLI modes, with three GPU cases deselected.

Source `aea5a0fc35` completes a TP1 original-weight LightX2V four-step request
on one V100, using column-major matrices and pageable host masters. The first
capacity check uses the smallest legal temporal extent (22 frames) on a
256x448 canvas; it is not a primary performance workload. The full request
passes basic media validation and peaks at 15,473,571,328 allocated GPU bytes.
Denoise takes 126.274887 seconds and the complete request 152.031041 seconds.
Recorded DiT weight loading takes 123.212966 seconds including the initial
3.769427-second resident setup outside denoise. Pageable staging accounts for
most host boundary time in this run.

The full contract, source/binary hashes, raw latents/RGB/PCM and stages are in
`/home/ymzx/h3-sm70-artifacts-20260909/runs/layer-offload-tp1-original-minimal/`.
The matching pinned-host run completes denoise in 53.840319 seconds and the
request in 67.370839 seconds, with the same GPU peak. Final video/audio latents,
all 22 pre-encoding frames and decoded PCM match the pageable run bitwise;
SSIM is 1 and audio RMS ratio is 1 (`layer-tp1-pinned-quality.json`). Recorded
DiT load/offload boundaries take 35.957164/15.261954 seconds; the latter includes
waiting for asynchronous copies and compute, not device-to-host weight traffic.
Both are captured cold capacity checks, not formal warmed speed measurements.

The full TP2 original-weight DiT also exceeds 32-GB/card capacity in component
mode: loading fails before denoise after the allocator's bounded retry. No
timing or output is claimed for that failed run. The matching layer policy
completes a full request with exact residual sharding, peaking at
15,449,646,080 allocated bytes/card. Denoise is 90.431030 seconds and request
latency 110.419366 seconds. A separate layer-mode control disables residual
sharding while preserving TP2, original weights, adapter, seed and sampling.
Final video/audio latents, all 22 RGB frames and decoded PCM match bitwise
(`layer-tp2-quality.json`). Both controls use shared pageable VAE masters.
The ordinary-residual cold request takes 166.482792 seconds denoise; variable
host paging and captures preclude a formal performance comparison.

Artifacts are `layer-offload-tp2-original-component/`,
`layer-offload-tp2-original-layer/` and
`layer-offload-tp2-original-layer-ordinary/` under the same `runs/` root.
Larger TP1/TP2 shapes remain pending. Neither these residency/sharding
comparisons nor the operator tests establish independent official full-model
quality or performance acceptance.
