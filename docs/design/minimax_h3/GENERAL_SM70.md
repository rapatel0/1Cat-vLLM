# General SM70 H3 acceleration campaign

Integration: `onecat/main`, base `4f19ef7a20db60bb0685e599bd3f4dd156202eed`.
Owned branch: `codex/v100-h3-general-sm70-20260908-165458`.
Raw evidence: `/data/minimax-h3/sm70-general-20260909/`.

## Accepted objective

Accelerate every supported H3 generation task across original floating-point
weights, W8A16, all eight LightX2V four/eight-step adapters, FlashGen, FastH3
Dense/VSA, TeaCache and Cache-DiT. Keep official task, adapter and sigma
contracts. Extract reusable SM70 DiT operators; a second complete model is
outside this campaign. Frontends continue to call the native vLLM API.

Use hardware, tensor layout/dtype, precision, adapter and collective capabilities
for dispatch. Preserve FP32 accumulation, residuals and wide-range scaling.
ConvRot applies only to matching rotated weights. LoRA receives the unrotated
activation and joins TP partial sums before reduction. Extend residual sequence
sharding to original weights, Ref2VA, adapters and TP2/TP4; TP1 remains ordinary
execution. AUTO may select only qualified routes.

Primary performance cases are the original 720p five-second four-step sample,
1344x768/243-frame official workload, and the 15-second boundary on TP4.
Count actual useful rank-local model work over the slowest rank's complete
denoise wall time, excluding padding, redundant work and skipped operations.
Sparse attention counts selected pairs and its actual compression projections;
cache savings are reported separately from arithmetic throughput. Record
actual denoiser calls, executed blocks and per-step/stage timing.

Acceptance requires one full warmup then three unprofiled measurements,
each rank's median above 80 TFLOP/s and denoise CV <= 5%, plus measured request
latency and memory. Smaller shapes and TP1/TP2 require compatibility checks.
The old 43.914752 TFLOP/s/card sample had 71.315842 s denoise and no warmup;
its equal-work 80 TFLOP/s budget is 39.147719 s. The old 39-frame/20-step
FA/FI diagnostics are not matching speed baselines.

After auditing duplicated column-LoRA A work, the current four-step numerator
is 3,103,284,010,387,456 useful FLOPs on rank 0. Its corrected 80-TFLOP/s budget
is 38.791050 seconds. Historical numbers above retain their original accounting
and must not be mixed with the corrected formal results below.

Quality compares each variant against the same weights, initial noise and
official algorithm, including full sampling. Default numerical gates are
video/audio final-latent relative L2 <= 0.01, pre-encoding video PSNR >= 40 dB
and SSIM >= 0.99, audio spectral cosine >= 0.99 and RMS ratio in [0.99, 1.01].
Complete audiovisual and reference-consistency review remains a separate gate.
Unaccepted drift is not a new oracle; thresholds must not be relaxed to pass.

## Development record

- Baseline and active PRs inspected; no overlapping H3 PR is open. Both prior
  attention directions and NVENC are merged at the declared base.
- All eight V100s were idle at preflight. Every GPU launch must acquire the
  native GPU lease and recheck actual processes; idle observations do not
  reserve a device.
- The attachment and complete accepted plan were read. No previous execution
  turn existed: the preceding turn produced a plan, not implementation evidence.
- Next: rebuild owned baseline extensions, prove the current numerical route,
  then implement shared prepared linear execution and residual sharding.

### First implementation checkpoint

- Fresh SM70 extensions built from the integration base; immutable paths and
  SHA256 recorded in `baseline-binaries.json`. The baseline runtime is a clean
  `git archive` of that SHA. Generated extension aliases are confined to the
  artifact bootstrap, preserving package ABI names without copying stale H3
  binaries from another task.
- `prepared-linear-v2.log`: 28 checks passed in the leased GPU batch (24 GPU
  checks and four CPU layout checks: shared GEMM, scaling, LoRA, activation,
  column-major plans). Prepared LoRA equals normal execution
  bitwise for original FP16 and W8A16, scales 0/0.75/-0.5, including explicit
  unrotated inputs beside rotated base operands.
- `candidate-tp2.log` and `candidate-tp4.log`: the complete distributed block
  case passes on all respective ranks. Cases include both attention backends,
  original and INT8 adapted blocks, consecutive blocks, padding and residuals
  exceeding FP16 range. This is not complete-model quality evidence.
- `core-regressions-v2.log`: 133 CPU adapter/config/API/conversion checks passed,
  one skipped and eight GPU cases deselected. Earlier export/import failures
  were missing video-extra dependencies in the new isolated environment.
  The environment now matches the retained native model-component versions;
  Torch remains 2.10.0+cu128. Both dynamic VAE classes import successfully.
- Failed setup paths retained: combining two distributed fixture lifetimes in
  one torchrun produced a Gloo rendezvous error after the first case passed;
  separate torchrun invocations resolve it. The first prepared run caught a
  removed compatibility export; the alias is restored and all 28 tests pass.
- The first full baseline stopped during VAE construction because the new
  environment lacked `diffusers`; no generated result or speed is claimed.
  Align the video dependencies with the retained native environment before retry.
- Active LoRA retains the normal unrotated gather in residual sharding. Its
  prepared row projections are enabled, and explicit dual-basis column input
  is supported, but reducing adapter input/gather overhead remains work.
- Original checkpoint loading rejects non-finite FP16 conversion, while keeping
  wide-range FP32 parameters intact. Tests cover BF16 overflow, infinity and NaN.
- Current full baseline: `baseline-720p-v2`, frozen integration Python source,
  fresh owned kernels, FA backend, no residual sharding, four-step v1.2 adapter,
  no FP16 weight cache, full warmup then one captured quality/timing request.
  This is a baseline acquisition, not the formal three-run acceptance.

### Complete four-step quality localization

The baseline completed on GPUs 0-3: one full warmup, then 66.206537 s denoise,
47.303750 TFLOP/s/card, four calls and 3,131,817,518,663,680 useful FLOPs/rank.
The first request took 83.139160 s denoise including fresh-cache startup; it is
excluded. Complete-request memory peaked at 18.162186 GiB allocated/card.
The baseline captured all latents and unencoded RGB/PCM; capture overhead is
outside denoise but included in VAE/end-to-end wall time.

`candidate-720p-residual` took 62.624739 s / 50.009271 TFLOP/s/card after one
warmup. **Rejected:** video/audio latent relative L2 is 0.2957225/0.0565235,
video PSNR 28.312 dB and SSIM 0.878025. Finite media and a 5.41% time reduction
do not satisfy the accepted quality gate. This is not a qualified speedup.

`candidate-720p-prepared-only` disables residual sharding while retaining every
new prepared/dense execution change. Complete video/audio latents match the
baseline bitwise; pre-encoding RGB matches exactly (SSIM 1.0), and all audio
gates pass. Its single cold request is a quality control, not a speed baseline.
This isolates the full-sampling regression to the residual route rather than
the newly generalized prepared matrix/LoRA path.

The residual implementation now uses the same full FP32 all-reduce as the
replicated path, then selects local residual rows. This intentionally gives up
the unqualified reduce-scatter communication saving. The distributed oracle
is tightened from a tolerance to bitwise equality; complete-model revalidation
is still required. Tensor-parallel GEMM, local normalization/residual ownership
and adapter support remain active. No >80 result or human acceptance exists.

`candidate-720p-exact-reduction` validates code `9623a9adb2`: complete video
and audio latents are **bitwise equal** to the frozen mainline baseline, all
124 pre-encoding frames match (SSIM 1.0), and all audio numerical gates pass.
See `exact-reduction-quality.json`. This was a single no-warmup quality request
(66.954238 s denoise); it is not a qualified performance comparison.

The tightened bitwise block oracle also passes on both TP2 ranks
(`exact-reduction-tp2-v3.log`) and all TP4 ranks (`exact-reduction-tp4.log`).
These results establish the sampled four-step route's numerical preservation,
not all adapters/partitions or human audiovisual acceptance. Draft PR #571
contains the implementation and remains Draft.

### Original floating-weight control and host memory

The first original checkpoint run was interrupted by a host restart and has no
result. The retry (`baseline-720p-original-v2`) was stopped during startup after
host usage reached 187 GiB with less than 1 GiB available and heavy swapping.
No denoise performance was recorded. Original-weight CPU masters per rank are
17,252,698,560 bytes DiT, 13,770,235,360 bytes encoder, 10,415,484,160 bytes video
VAE and 605,306,340 bytes audio VAE, before loader/allocator overhead.

Two complete controls therefore used identical **pageable** CPU masters for
all four components, with otherwise unchanged sampling, original BF16 checkpoint
converted through the existing FP16/FP32 runtime, LightX2V four-step v1.2 and FA:

| Quality control | Denoise seconds | Useful TFLOP/s/card |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Frozen mainline, ordinary residuals and row layout | 69.044838 | 45.359844 |
| General prepared path, column layout, exact residual sharding | 66.426983 | 47.147453 |

These are single no-warmup quality requests; the timing difference is **not an
accepted speedup**. Full video/audio latents match bitwise, all 124 decoded RGB
frames match (SSIM 1.0), spectral cosine is effectively 1 and RMS ratio is 1.
See `baseline-720p-original-pageable`, `candidate-720p-original-column` and
`original-column-quality.json`. These prove preservation of frozen mainline for
this original-weight workflow, not independent official or human acceptance.

The corresponding native deployment option is `host_weight_pin_memory=False`
or `--disable-host-weight-pinning`, applied to the DiT, encoder and both VAEs.
It preserves values, aliases and layouts and changes host residency/transfers
only. Automatic host/GPU memory budgeting remains further work. The recorded
complete controls used an artifact-local stager option before the native flag
was added; they must not be presented as full native-flag generation evidence.
`host-memory-cpu-v1.log`: 43 config/VAE/workflow/API checks pass.
`host-memory-gpu-v1.log`: two pinned/pageable alias-preserving repeated transfer
checks pass. The full original-weight native-flag run is still pending.

The separate workflow-metrics branch replaces fixed 49-call validation with
actual sigma intervals and step/block counts. Its results and formal FA/FI
comparisons will be recorded independently. No >80 configuration is qualified.

### Current shared storage and campaign checkpoints

The later native-flag run at `324f2463c78fb0f69d1546c817e67f3802e52342`
also enables explicit shared VAE host storage. Full original-weight Light4
latents, RGB and PCM match the original column-weight control bitwise.
TP4 VAE mappings total 11.02 GB physical PSS instead of four physical replicas,
and the engine cleans up its owned files. See [shared host weights](SHARED_HOST_WEIGHTS.md).
This supersedes the pending native-flag status above; warmed request speed
and automatic memory budgeting remain unqualified.

The accounting branch corrects duplicate column-LoRA A projections. For the
four-step W8A16 sample, useful rank-zero FLOPs are now
3,103,284,010,387,456; the equal-work 80 TFLOP/s budget is approximately
38.79 seconds. Earlier TFLOP/s values in this historical record use the old
numerator and must not be mixed with corrected results.

The kernel branch's full warmup plus three unprofiled query-128 requests take
59.743807 / 59.748563 / 59.748666 seconds, median 51.939 TFLOP/s/card and
CV 0.003793%. Light4 and Light8 complete native-control comparisons pass
bitwise for video/audio latents, RGB and PCM. Neither establishes independent
official-model or human quality acceptance. The >80 gate still fails.

The variants branch completes native FlashGen, FastH3 Dense and true VSA
generation. VSA's full FP32 selected-key attention control produces final
video/audio latent L2 errors 0.390670/0.088636, PSNR 24.277 dB and SSIM
0.769774: it is unqualified despite small local operator errors. Unmodified
official FastVideo Triton cannot compile FP16 inputs on this V100 setup;
an independent compatible official runtime remains required.

Both request caches complete original-weight TP4 cached/lossless/cached
generation at 256x448, 107 internal frames and 49 intervals. TeaCache records
5/0/5 hits and Cache-DiT 34/0/34, with repeated latents/RGB bitwise and PCM
within the declared gates. These are lifecycle checks, not full official
quality or the primary performance matrix. Subsequent branch documents hold
the detailed records; their APIs are not all present in this common-base PR.

### Original projection conversion audit

`float-matrix-conversion-audit.json` scans every original attention/MLP matrix
that the native model executes in FP16, including the token refiners: 208
matrices and 20,038,287,360 values per partition. Protected FP32 normalization,
AdaLN and embedding parameters are outside this conversion. The audit retains
each source tensor's SHA256, shape/dtype, conversion error and underflow count.
Checkpoint revision is `42ed227ee7df40d41602854ae760620d6eb651fe`.

| Partition | Aggregate relative L2 | Maximum matrix relative L2 | Nonzero values underflowed to zero | Overflow / non-finite input |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| FL2VA | 9.000060e-10 | 4.256286e-9 | 4,055 | 0 / 0 |
| Ref2VA | 9.004251e-10 | 4.208590e-9 | 4,058 | 0 / 0 |

This explicitly records FP16 subnormal-range loss; conversion is not claimed
to preserve every source bit. No value clipping is performed. The loading
guard still rejects FP16 overflow. These weight-only measurements do not
replace the final latent, video and audio quality gates.

The official eight LightX2V files are now present and hash-verified against
repository revision `2f015e66b37c585cea9dc4ae6f1850ea8788e742`. Native header
inspection accepts all eight with the recipe's task families, four/eight
intervals, five/nine sigma points, flow shifts and alpha values; see
`official-variants/all-lightx2v-inventory.json`. Download/header validation is
not full GPU generation or acceptance for the remaining adapter versions.

The kernel branch's Ref2VA eight-step mixed image/video/audio control also
passes frozen-native latent/RGB/PCM comparison bitwise, with 69,325 valid DiT
tokens. Its single captured denoise is 366.799932 seconds; no formal three-run
or independent official quality qualification is claimed.
