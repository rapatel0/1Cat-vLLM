# Explicit SM70 local-row reduction

The shared `SM70ExactRowReductionPlan` interface is experimental and has no
automatic dispatch. H3 exposes an explicit runtime selection; its native
four-step integration passes media preservation and remains below the
formal >80 throughput gate. The ordinary residual path
continues to use FP32 all-reduce followed by a local-row slice. No configuration
has passed the campaign's >80 useful TFLOP/s/card and complete quality gates.

## Arithmetic and ownership

A conventional reduce-scatter changes FP32 addition order relative to the
existing all-reduce, and the earlier full H3 control failed numerical gates.
This interface instead classifies the native communicator's addition order
for the actual two-dimensional FP32 shape. Ten fixed finite probes distinguish
all 15 four-input binary addition trees. Unmatched or ambiguous elements reject
setup collectively. Calibration never reads model weights or model activations.

The CUDA implementation copies each rank's partial input into owned IPC
storage, reads only its destination rows from peers and evaluates the calibrated
tree with rounded FP32 additions. System release/acquire flags establish input
visibility and completion. The grid has 80 blocks; the interface requires
SM70 devices with at least 80 SMs, four distinct peer-accessible devices on
one host, and consistent CUDA visibility. All row-parallel adapter contributions
must already be included in the input.

The caller supplies an explicit budget covering persistent IPC buffers,
local output, one-byte arithmetic codes and calibration scratch. GPU buffers
belong to the plan, not a global shape cache. Returned tensors alias the plan's
output; consume them before the next call. Call `close()` collectively before
tearing down the TP group. Rank-dependent setup errors are exchanged over the
CPU group, and peer handles close before owners free their allocations.

The plan rejects another stream/device, autograd inputs, incompatible layouts,
CUDA Graph execution and epoch exhaustion. It does not silently change a
backend or precision. Callers retain their ordinary collective when a plan
is unsuitable. H3 owns one plan per pipeline, reuses it for identical shapes and closes it
collectively on shape changes or worker shutdown. Other models must likewise
own the plan lifecycle explicitly.

## Validation and measured limits

Environment: Torch 2.10.0+cu128, CUDA toolkit 12.8.93, NCCL 2.27.5, four leased
V100 SXM2 32GB cards. Evidence root:
`/data/minimax-h3/sm70-general-20260909/exact-peer-reduction/`.

- The first arithmetic classification covers every element of the real
  34560x5376 projection. Three independent wide-range inputs and signed-zero
  controls match the native all-reduce bitwise.
- The source implementation's TP4 control covers seven shapes from 4x3 through
  34560x5376, including non-H3 DiT widths, tails and non-aligned storage offsets.
  All four ranks preserve bits for ordinary, wide, subnormal and opposing
  infinity inputs: 112 numerical cases. Mismatched shapes, insufficient
  per-rank budgets, different streams and closed plans are rejected.
- The prototype's independent four-rank memcheck fixture reports zero errors
  on every rank. An earlier NCCL-bearing fixture reported only initialization
  `cudaFuncGetAttributes` probes for unsupported kernels; NCCL explicitly
  skips that return code in its [corresponding source](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl/blob/v2.27.5-1/src/enqueue.cc#L37-L38).
  The isolated fixture uses Gloo for coordination and an independent FP32
  arithmetic reference; no CUDA API error suppression was applied.
- Source operator medians, including the full input copy and device barriers:
  native 14.561–14.641 ms, peer rows 10.939–10.991 ms. These seven alternating
  measurements are communication diagnostics only.
- A separate artifact override at source `3280edbfcc` completes a full denoise
  warmup per implementation, then one measurement each: 59.717282 seconds
  native versus 58.228244 seconds peer rows, a 2.49348% reduction. Candidate
  useful throughput is 53.295148–53.295167 TFLOP/s/card. Every final video/audio
  latent bit matches across all four passes, and the baseline also matches
  the previously frozen FA query-128 control. Each candidate pass uses 400
  peer reductions. This is not the full-request warmup-plus-three protocol.
- The prototype's full native media control also preserves both final latents,
  all 124 RGB frames and PCM bitwise. SSIM and RMS ratio are 1; spectral cosine
  exceeds 0.99999999999998. Its captured cold request takes 94.269191 seconds,
  including 61.688596 seconds denoise. This is native preservation, not an
  independent official-model or human audiovisual review.
- That full request peaks at 19,732,554,240 PyTorch-allocated bytes/card plus
  743,180,800 persistent raw IPC bytes/card. Their sum is 20,475,735,040 bytes;
  driver/library overhead is additional. Do not report only the PyTorch number.

The committed shared interface at `6d2a44b8d0` now also passes a complete
native H3 control using an explicit forward override. Dynamic calibration uses
the current native group and the actual shape, with no saved arithmetic-code
map. Final video/audio latents, all 124 RGB frames and PCM match the frozen
FA query-128 control bitwise; SSIM and RMS ratio are 1. The captured request
records 58.310740 seconds denoise and 99.562953 seconds total. Its contract,
source/binary manifests, `review-native-quality.json` and
`review-native-summary.json` are retained separately from prototype evidence.

This validates the final shared operator in one H3 request, but does not establish full-request warmup-plus-three performance.
Final native integration validation, formal repeated requests, TP/shape breadth and official/human
quality gates remain incomplete. No AUTO promotion is made.

Reproduce the operator control with an owned native GPU lease and
`torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=4
benchmarks/kernels/benchmark_sm70_exact_row_reduce.py --output <new-directory>
--full-shape`. The optional `--extension` pins an already-built library; the
report records its SHA256 plus benchmark, CUDA and shared Python source hashes.

## Native API selection and memory records

Start `vllm video serve` or `vllm video generate` with
`--residual-sequence-parallel --residual-reduction peer
--residual-reduction-memory-gib 4` to select the explicit candidate. The default
remains `native`; HTTP clients continue to use the existing video API. Selection
does not depend on floating versus W8A16 weights, adapters or task labels.

TP1 retains its ordinary path. TP2 uses the original all-reduce and local slice.
TP4 creates a shared plan only when its complete calibration/storage requirement
fits the explicit budget; larger shapes use the ordinary collective. A plan
remains valid only for its original communicator and shape. Setup happens on
the first actual projection; its time is included in complete denoise and is
also reported separately in `residual_communication.setup_seconds`. Repeated
requests of the same shape reuse calibration without reading model state.

Each result records peer/native call counts and the fallback reason. The
`torch_peak_allocated_bytes` and `raw_ipc_peak_bytes` fields remain separate;
`peak_allocated_bytes` is their conservative sum and is marked as an upper
bound when raw IPC storage is present. The performance validator therefore
includes external communication allocations in its memory gate. CUDA driver
and library overhead still require the retained NVML measurements.

CPU request ownership, budget fallback, config, API and existing residual
regressions pass. The final native selection now has the separate controls and measurements
below. Wider workflow validation remains incomplete.

## Final native four-step measurements

At source `ca82c279bc`, the ordinary engine selects peer rows through H3Config,
with no forward replacement. The separate captured native request preserves
both final latents, all 124 RGB frames and PCM bitwise. All four ranks report
400 peer calls, zero native fallbacks and about 0.374 seconds initial plan
setup. `peer-api-native-quality.json` and `peer-api-native-summary.json` retain
this control and its precise configuration.

`peer-api-720p-three-runs/performance.json` records one complete request warmup
and three unprofiled, uncaptured requests of that same configuration:

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Warmup denoise | 59.698783 s |
| Measured denoise | 58.344130 / 58.293218 / 58.234342 s |
| Median useful TFLOP/s/card | 53.235745–53.235764 |
| Denoise coefficient of variation | 0.076959% |
| Complete request | 91.071940 / 90.560870 / 91.905029 s |
| Live allocation upper bound, including IPC | 20,475,227,136 bytes/card |
| Memory gate | Pass |
| >80 throughput gate | Fail |

The companion `peer-api-formal-telemetry.json` retains 1,995 NVML samples at a
0.25-second interval. Across startup, warmup and measurement, the maximum
sampled device usage is 24,387,256,320 bytes, including allocator caches and
runtime overhead. High-utilization samples have median power of about
278–280 W/card. Telemetry is independent of the CUDA work counters.

This formal request uses pageable host masters and shared VAE weights; the
older FA query-128 formal control used pinned masters. The latter's shorter
complete-request time must not be presented as a matched comparison of the
communication kernels. The isolated 2.49348% denoise comparison above used
matching host and compute settings. No overall request speedup is claimed
across the different host-memory policies.

The interface remains explicit. The >80 target, official/human quality, wider
workflow and shape/TP matrix are still incomplete. Initial setup, skipped work,
raw IPC storage and slower end-to-end outcomes are retained in the records.

## Native backend and workload breadth

The same native API path with register-probability FI also passes a complete
latent/RGB/PCM bitwise control against its frozen FI baseline. Full-request
warmup plus three unprofiled measurements record denoise
60.986616 / 60.889535 / 60.969633 seconds, median
50.898828-50.898847 useful TFLOP/s/card and CV 0.069457%. Complete requests take
89.859034 / 89.086770 / 89.525699 seconds. The allocation upper bound including
raw IPC is 20,475,227,136 bytes/card. FA and FI peer runs share the pageable
host/shared VAE policy. Both fail the >80 gate. Evidence:
`peer-api-fi-720p-three-runs/performance.json`,
`peer-api-fi-native-quality.json` and `peer-api-fi-formal-telemetry.json`.

Additional complete native controls preserve video/audio latents, all 124 RGB
frames and PCM bitwise with original floating Light4 weights and W8A16 Ref4
mixed image/video/audio conditioning. Original Light4 records 59.323955 seconds
denoise and 22,022,771,200 bytes/card allocation upper bound. Ref4 records
181.260984 seconds and 21,572,765,184 bytes/card; its longer reference sequence
uses an explicit 8 GiB reduction budget and 1,491,864,064 raw IPC bytes/card.
Both record 400 peer calls with zero native fallbacks. These are captured cold
quality controls, not formal repeated performance measurements. Evidence:
`peer-api-breadth-summary.json` and both corresponding `*-quality.json` files.
Independent official quality, human review and the full task/weight/shape
matrix remain incomplete.
