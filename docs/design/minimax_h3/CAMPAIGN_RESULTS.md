# H3 SM70 campaign results

No configuration has completed the >80 useful TFLOP/s/card, independent official quality and human-review gates.

Development concentrates on FlashAttention-V100. FI retains its validated implementation; further FI optimization and exhaustive acceptance are paused at the user request. Quality and workflow gates remain unchanged.

All rows use TP4. Rows marked formal use a complete request warmup plus three unprofiled requests. Other timings are captured cold diagnostics. Original floating-weight controls with legacy FLOP accounting omit throughput.

The VSA failure is against an explicitly labeled FP32 selected-key diagnostic, not the unmodified official GPU kernel. Generation alone does not establish numerical quality.

- Only explicitly marked formal rows are full-request warmup-plus-three result; other timings are captured cold diagnostics.
- Useful FLOPs exclude padding, duplicate work and skipped sparse/cache work; denominator is the slowest complete-denoise rank.
- Native parity does not establish independent official-model or human audiovisual quality.
- The 720p-family request uses an internal 1280x736/124-frame canvas; Ref2VA has longer conditioning sequences.
- First/last/both keyframes pass native controls for W8A16 Light4 v1.2; remaining adapter/weight keyframes, legal reference combinations, and primary-shape/TP matrix remain incomplete.
- TeaCache and Cache-DiT/SCM currently have separate small-shape lifecycle evidence, not primary >80 or official quality acceptance.

Exact source/run paths and the evidence index are retained in `campaign-results.json` and `campaign-results.csv`.
