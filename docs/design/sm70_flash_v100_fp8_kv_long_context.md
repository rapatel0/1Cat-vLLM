# SM70 Flash-V100 FP8 KV Long-Context Optimization

Date: 2026-07-15

## Scope And Status

The original sections of this document own the FP8 E5M2 KV-cache
long-context path for Qwen3.6-27B-AWQ on TP2 V100. The 2026-09-14 update
extends the same route-parity policy to E4M3 KV for the GQA6/D256 shapes used
by Qwen3.8-27B. The accepted runtime uses TurboMind AWQ,
`FLASH_ATTN_V100`, prefix caching, Mamba align mode, CUDA graphs, and no eager
execution.

Both identified route gaps are now implemented and default enabled:

- prefill: one-pass E5M2 expansion into a shared FP16 page-784 workspace;
- decode: vectorized E5M2 XQA with CUDA-graph capture support.

The prefill BM32 route supports a final partial query tile. This is required
for MTP4 align mode, whose scheduler chunk is 1616 tokens (`50*32+16`), rather
than the no-MTP 1568-token chunk.

The changes preserve the old FP8 model output hashes for the measured 16K and
64K official-sampling cases. FP8 quantization quality relative to FP16 remains
a separate model-level acceptance question; these kernels add no observed
quality regression relative to the prior FP8 route.

## Original Failure

The matched historical no-MTP FP8 baseline regressed increasingly with
context length:

| Context | FP16 prefill | Old FP8 prefill | FP16 TPOT | Old FP8 TPOT |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 16K | 10.098 s | 14.680 s | 19.532 ms | 21.762 ms |
| 64K | 60.328 s | 127.842 s | 26.014 ms | 32.768 ms |
| 128K | 169.206 s | 450.290 s | 35.218 ms | 47.119 ms |

This was not an intrinsic FP8 bandwidth penalty.

## Root Cause

### Prefill

The TP2 full-attention shape is `Hq=12,Hkv=2,D=256`, with scheduler chunk
`M=1568` and Mamba-aligned KV pages of 1568 tokens.

Two route losses multiplied together:

1. Page 1568 did not select the FP16 page-784 BM32 phase kernel. At 128K,
   FP16 page 784 took 115.175 ms per layer while FP16 page 1568 took
   264.380 ms.
2. The generic FP8 kernel performed page lookup and E5M2 expansion inside
   every query CTA. At the same page size, FP8 page 1568 took 565.320 ms.

NCU showed that this was not HBM saturation. The generic FP8 prefill kernel
used 96.64 KiB dynamic shared memory, admitted one CTA per SM, reached only
25% occupancy, and had about 4% tensor activity. It repeatedly converted the
same KV values for the many query CTAs.

### Decode

E5M2 conversion itself was already cheap. At 64K, FP8 scalar decode was
slightly faster than FP16 scalar decode. The regression came from the Python
and C++ XQA gates accepting only FP16 KV.

The scalar GQA kernel launched one CTA per query head and partition. For
`q_per_kv=6`, that launched 768 CTAs and reread each KV head six times. XQA
launches one CTA per KV head and partition, or 128 CTAs for the same 64K case.

## Correctness Defect Found During Bring-Up

The first bridge experiment reached about 4.8x prefill speedup but failed the
numeric gate when `Hkv>1`. The BM32 PV path used a hard-coded V token stride of
256. That was valid only for `Hkv=1`; TP2 requires a stride of
`Hkv*D = 512`.

The fix passes the live `v_token_stride` to both PV WMMA loads. BM32 is now
bitwise equal to the prior accurate path for `Hkv=1,2,3`, causal attention,
reverse page tables, and tail pages. This was a latent FP16 BM32 defect, not an
FP8 quantization error.

## Implemented Prefill Path

`fp8_e5m2_paged_kv_to_fp16` performs one vectorized gather/expansion pass:

- reads two E5M2 values at a time and expands them exactly into `half2`;
- resolves non-contiguous physical pages through the live block table;
- supports partial tail pages and non-unit K/V scales;
- writes into preallocated FP16 pages of 784 tokens;
- performs no allocation or host synchronization inside the CUDA op.

The downstream BM32 kernel uses a ceil-divided query grid. Full 32-row CTAs
retain the original unguarded load/store path; only the final partial CTA
zero-fills missing query rows and guards output/LSE writes. This preserves the
fast schedule while making `M=1616` a first-class route instead of sending the
first 1600 rows through the generic FP8 kernel.

The backend workspace is shared across attention layers and keyed by GPU,
CUDA stream, `Hkv`, and head dimension. At 256K and `Hkv=2,D=256`, one K/V
workspace costs about 512 MiB per rank. It is reused serially by all full
attention layers, rather than allocating one copy per layer. FP8 still saves
substantially more memory across the model than this single workspace costs.

Prefill microbenchmark, `M=1568,Hq=12,Hkv=2,D=256`:

| Context | Old FP8 page-1568 | Bridge total | Expansion only | Speedup |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 16K | 66.378 ms | 14.670 ms | 0.108 ms | 4.52x |
| 64K | 280.102 ms | 57.985 ms | 0.386 ms | 4.83x |
| 128K | 565.159 ms | 115.826 ms | 0.764 ms | 4.88x |

The bridge output and final attention output are bitwise equal to the old FP8
path for unit and non-unit scales.

MTP4-aligned microbenchmark, `M=1616`, page 1616:

| Context | Old FP8 | Bridge total | Expansion only | Speedup |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 16K | 61.500 ms | 15.904 ms | 0.108 ms | 3.87x |
| 64K | 255.623 ms | 62.905 ms | 0.387 ms | 4.06x |

The 16-row partial CTA is bitwise equal to the prior accurate FP8 path in the
targeted CUDA regression.

## Implemented Decode Path

The XQA panel loader now supports FP8 E5M2:

- one aligned 8-byte global load reads eight E5M2 values;
- register bit expansion produces eight FP16 values for shared-memory staging;
- the existing HMMA/XQA schedule then serves six query heads from one KV read;
- `k_scale` is applied with the score scale and `v_scale` with partition output,
  matching the scalar path's scale placement.

Non-graph execution uses scalar below 8K and XQA at or above 8K. CUDA-graph
capture is explicitly marked by the metadata builder and fixes the captured
FP8 route to XQA; a graph cannot switch kernels later as context grows.

Decode microbenchmark, page 1568:

| Context | FP8 scalar | FP8 XQA | Speedup |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 4K | 0.137 ms | 0.136 ms | 1.00x |
| 8K | 0.204 ms | 0.153 ms | 1.34x |
| 16K | 0.286 ms | 0.227 ms | 1.26x |
| 64K | 0.841 ms | 0.577 ms | 1.46x |
| 128K | 1.437 ms | 1.053 ms | 1.37x |

The maximum scalar-versus-XQA error was at most `6.11e-5` in the tested
contexts and at most `3.05e-5` for non-unit scales.

### NCU Proof At 64K

| Metric | FP8 scalar | FP8 XQA |
|---|---:|---:|
| Partition kernel | 844.32 us | 534.18 us |
| Grid size | 768 CTAs | 128 CTAs |
| Registers/thread | 44 | 186 |
| Dynamic/shared memory | 12.88 KiB static | 43.26 KiB dynamic |
| Achieved occupancy | 53.50% | 12.49% |
| DRAM throughput | 7.24% | 11.59% |
| L2 hit rate | 87.21% | 4.43% |
| Memory throughput | 81.94 GB/s | 130.93 GB/s |

The lower XQA L2 hit rate is expected: scalar repeatedly rereads the same KV
for six query heads, while XQA removes those cache hits by removing the
redundant requests. XQA remains register/shared-memory limited and does not
saturate DRAM.

## Full-Model Result

Matched contract: Qwen3.6-27B-AWQ, TP2 V100, FP8 E5M2 KV, TurboMind AWQ,
Flash-V100, `max_model_len=262144`, `max_num_batched_tokens=2048`, prefix
caching, Mamba align, `FULL_AND_PIECEWISE`, no eager, 256 forced output tokens,
and official `temperature=1.0,top_p=0.95,top_k=20,seed=20260620` sampling.

| Context | Old FP8 prefill | New prefill | Prefill delta | Old FP8 TPOT | New TPOT | Decode tok/s delta |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 16K | 14.680 s | 10.317 s | -29.72% | 21.762 ms | 19.715 ms | +10.39% |
| 64K | 127.842 s | 62.964 s | -50.75% | 32.768 ms | 26.910 ms | +21.77% |

The bridge-only intermediate TPOT was 20.721 ms at 16K and 30.625 ms at 64K.
The remaining drop to 19.715/26.910 ms is the CUDA-graph FP8 XQA propagation.
Both final 256-token hashes exactly match the old FP8 baseline:

- 16K: `bbf3175c6946c021376d51d26ecc7c21ae8d3e22baed664b475508534cb8b587`
- 64K: `100b97590c707aecd4398eba34e12e2087f5b793ef8e0073492393c08ba04892`

### MTP4 Propagation

Matched MTP4 adds `num_speculative_tokens=4`, probabilistic draft sampling,
local argmax reduction, and an explicit Flash-V100 drafter. The old FP8 and
new FP8 runs use the same TP2 GPU pair and all other fields from the contract
above.

| Context | FP16 prefill control | Old FP8 prefill | New FP8 prefill | Prefill vs old FP8 | FP16 TPOT | Old FP8 TPOT | New FP8 TPOT | Acceptance length |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 16K | 11.367 s | 13.977 s | 9.972 s | -28.66% | 10.056 ms | 10.104 ms | 10.072 ms | 4.8679 |
| 64K | 79.301 s | 123.412 s | 56.441 s | -54.27% | 17.832 ms | 18.179 ms | 18.020 ms | 4.8113 |

The new MTP4 output hashes equal both the old FP8 run and the matched no-MTP
run at 16K/64K. Acceptance length is unchanged. FP8 decode is now within about
1.1% of the FP16 MTP4 TPOT control at 64K; most of the prior visible MTP4 FP8
regression was prefill, because speculative acceptance already hid much of the
old scalar-decode cost.

## TP4 And Cross-Quantization Coverage

The TP4 acceptance contract matches the TP2 contract above except for four
V100s and `tensor_parallel_size=4`. Every full-model row below uses TurboMind,
Flash-V100, non-eager CUDA graphs, prefix caching, Mamba align,
`max_model_len=262144`, `max_num_batched_tokens=2048`, one request, 256 forced
output tokens, and official `temperature=1.0,top_p=0.95,top_k=20` sampling.

### TP4 Operator Shapes

The per-rank full-attention shapes differ enough that TP2-only evidence is not
sufficient:

| Model | TP4 shape | No-MTP page | MTP4 page | Production decode decision |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| Qwen3.6-27B | `Hq=6,Hkv=1,D=256,G=6` | 1568 | 1616 | FP8 XQA at long context |
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B | `Hq=4,Hkv=1,D=256,G=4` | 1056 | 1088 | FP8 scalar |

The TP4 microbenchmarks are:

| Shape | Context | Old FP8 prefill | Bridge | Prefill speedup | FP8 scalar decode | FP8 XQA decode |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 27B `Hq6/Hkv1` | 16K | 39.924 ms | 8.362 ms | 4.77x | 0.208 ms | 0.155 ms |
| 27B `Hq6/Hkv1` | 64K | 159.522 ms | 32.966 ms | 4.84x | 0.557 ms | 0.338 ms |
| 35B `Hq4/Hkv1` | 16K | 24.339 ms | 6.397 ms | 3.80x | 0.166 ms | 0.171 ms |
| 35B `Hq4/Hkv1` | 64K | 96.449 ms | 25.289 ms | 3.81x | 0.366 ms | 0.339 ms |

FP8 G4 XQA was not promoted. It loses at 16K, saved only 0.027 ms in the 64K
operator microbenchmark, and produced no full-model gain. Production therefore
keeps 35B TP4 FP8 decode on the scalar route while retaining the bridge for
prefill. The G4 XQA kernel remains covered by a scalar-versus-XQA numerical
regression, but is not a production route. Sampled hashes varied across both
XQA and fresh scalar processes, so that variation is not attributed to XQA.

### TP4 Full-Model No-MTP Matrix

The table compares current FP8 E5M2 KV against the matched FP16 KV control. A
positive TPOT delta is residual FP8 decode overhead; a negative prefill delta
is a bridge win over the FP16 control, not merely over the old generic FP8
path.

| Weight route | Context | FP16 prefill | FP8 prefill | Prefill delta | FP16 TPOT | FP8 TPOT | TPOT delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 27B AWQ | 16K | 5.064 s | 5.198 s | +2.65% | 13.706 ms | 13.924 ms | +1.59% |
| 27B AWQ | 64K | 30.213 s | 31.116 s | +2.99% | 17.283 ms | 17.458 ms | +1.02% |
| 35B-A3B AWQ | 16K | 2.101 s | 2.603 s | +23.87% | 9.074 ms | 9.322 ms | +2.73% |
| 35B-A3B AWQ | 64K | 14.111 s | 10.917 s | -22.63% | 11.328 ms | 11.459 ms | +1.16% |
| 35B-A3B FP8 weights | 16K | 2.024 s | 1.981 s | -2.10% | 9.781 ms | 9.961 ms | +1.84% |
| 35B-A3B FP8 weights | 64K | 14.618 s | 10.120 s | -30.77% | 12.043 ms | 12.101 ms | +0.49% |
| 27B NVFP4 | 16K | 6.167 s | 6.146 s | -0.35% | 14.337 ms | 14.504 ms | +1.16% |
| 27B NVFP4 | 64K | 35.147 s | 33.961 s | -3.37% | 17.890 ms | 18.050 ms | +0.90% |

The 27B NVFP4 logs contain `SM70 compressed-tensors NVFP4 TurboMind W4A16
dense path enabled`; no Marlin route is present. Compressed-tensors models
without a checkpoint `kv_cache_scheme` now use the same explicit unit-scale
E5M2 KV override as other compatible quantized checkpoints. An explicit
checkpoint KV scale scheme remains rejected.

The 27B AWQ and NVFP4 FP16/FP8 pairs have identical 16K and 64K output hashes.
The 35B sampled hashes can differ between FP16 and FP8 KV because the cache
dtype itself changes attention arithmetic. The relevant implementation gate is
stronger and more local: page 1056 and page 1088 bridge outputs are bitwise
equal to the previous accurate FP8 path for the tested full and partial query
chunks.

### TP4 MTP4 Pair

TP4 MTP originally failed before model execution because the default resolver
hard-coded the TP2 ranking artifact. The resolver now selects the ranking asset
from runtime tensor-parallel size, and all four ranks load
`sm70_mtp_dynamic_vocab_qwen36_27b_tp4.pt`.

| Context | FP16 prefill | FP8 prefill | Prefill delta | FP16 TPOT | FP8 TPOT | TPOT delta | FP16 AL | FP8 AL |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 16K | 6.189 s | 5.433 s | -12.21% | 7.393 ms | 7.577 ms | +2.50% | 4.8679 | 4.6364 |
| 64K | 44.639 s | 31.742 s | -28.89% | 11.421 ms | 11.390 ms | -0.27% | 4.8113 | 4.8113 |

At 64K, FP8 KV no longer adds MTP decode decay and cuts prefill by 28.89%.
The single 16K sample has a 4.76% acceptance-length difference and a different
sampled hash, so it is performance/route evidence, not a natural-prompt MTP
quality promotion. The 64K sample has identical acceptance length and output
hash. A natural-prompt multi-case quality gate is still required before making
a new 35B or FP8-MTP serving recommendation.

There is no valid 27B NVFP4 MTP body in the available checkpoint, and there is
no local 35B NVFP4 checkpoint. Those combinations are recorded as unavailable,
not silently replaced by AWQ. Full-model 35B MTP is also deferred until a
35B-specific dynamic-vocabulary ranking is generated; the 35B MTP page-1088
attention shape is covered by the bitwise operator regression.

## Runtime Controls

- `VLLM_FLASH_V100_FP8_PREFILL_BRIDGE=0`: disable the prefill bridge.
- `VLLM_FLASH_V100_DECODE_USE_XQA=0`: disable all XQA decode.
- `VLLM_FLASH_V100_DECODE_FP8_XQA_MIN_SEQ_LEN=8192`: non-graph FP8 XQA
  crossover threshold.

The bridge and FP8 XQA are enabled by default under their strict shape and
dtype gates. FP8 E4M3 is not routed through either E5M2 implementation.

## Closed And Remaining Work

Do not retry scalar E5M2 conversion tuning as the primary solution. Conversion
was not the decode bottleneck, and prefill needed conversion reuse rather than
a cheaper repeated conversion.

The remaining XQA kernel has 186 registers/thread, one CTA/SM, and 73.3% cycles
with no eligible warp in NCU. Reducing that resource footprint is a valid next
kernel project, but the first-order FP8 long-context regression is closed.
Before further work, measure its share of final TPOT; do not optimize the
534-us partition kernel as though it were the entire model token latency.

For the original E5M2 work, the 256K full-model point remains unmeasured. The
128K operator microbenchmark is complete; any future E5M2 full-model run should
be a confirmation gate rather than another route-discovery experiment. The
separate E4M3 update below includes a 256K full-model result.

## 2026-09-14 E4M3 Route Parity And Long-Page Repair

The E4M3 GQA6/D256 route now shares the production FP16 attention schedules
where the shape matches:

- prefix prefill performs one E4M3-to-FP16 gather into the shared page-784
  workspace, then calls the default Q8000/Q8192 FP16-Tensor-Core, FP32-
  accumulated dense kernel;
- uniform decode uses the E4M3 XQA route for B1 and batches larger than 16;
- small query rows in a mixed chunked-prefill batch are grouped into one paged
  decode/XQA call instead of walking their long prefix through prefill;
- B1 long decode uses device-side p64/p256/p512/p896/p1664 wave selection for
  any 16-aligned page size of at least 256 tokens, including page 800 and page
  1568;
- E4M3 XQA keeps softmax probabilities, PV accumulation state, partition
  outputs, and the final partition reduction in FP32. The public output remains
  FP16, matching the model interface.

These routes are default on. Their environment variables are rollback controls,
not admission requirements. The supported E4M3 XQA specialization remains the
measured GQA6/D256 shape; unrelated GQA ratios keep their accurate existing
route.

### Page-800 Correctness Root Cause

The first 256K p896 and p1664 measurements differed from scalar decode by as
much as `1.2546e-3`. Changing FP16 partition storage to FP32 did not change the
error. The defect was address calculation: the page-800 specialized loader
encoded only logical pages zero and one, while a p896 partition can span three
pages and a p1664 partition can span four. It therefore read valid memory from
the wrong page for the later tokens.

The loader now computes logical pages zero through three and sizes the
partition page list with ceil division. A regression compares the wave routes
with the scalar p256 oracle at the page boundaries that expose this defect.

### CUDA-Graph Operator Gate

All rows below capture both scalar and XQA calls in `torch.cuda.CUDAGraph` on a
V100-SXM2-32GB. No eager server configuration is used.

| Shape | Page | Context | Scalar | E4M3 XQA | Speedup | Max abs diff |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| B1/Hq6/Hkv1/D256 | 800 | 256K | 3.2975 ms | 0.4834 ms | 6.82x | 0 |
| B1/Hq6/Hkv1/D256 | 1568 | 256K | 3.4051 ms | 0.4922 ms | 6.92x | `2.38e-7` |
| B8/Hq6/Hkv1/D256 | 800 | 256K | 24.8675 ms | 3.8455 ms | 6.47x | `2.38e-7` |
| B32/Hq6/Hkv1/D256 | 800 | 64K | 24.7134 ms | 3.7532 ms | 6.58x | `9.54e-7` |
| B32/Hq6/Hkv1/D256 | 800 | 256K | 96.4159 ms | 14.6154 ms | 6.60x | `4.77e-7` |

The explicit B1 page-800 partition checks are bitwise equal for p512 and
p1664; p896 has `1.19e-7` maximum absolute difference. These data separate the
kernel quality claim from model sampling: the fast route is now numerically
aligned with the established scalar E4M3 implementation before any full-model
quality comparison.

### Full-Model CUDA-Graph Gate

The end-to-end gate uses four V100-SXM2-32GB GPUs, Torch 2.10.0+cu128, TP4,
the Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4 checkpoint through its compressed-tensors metadata,
FP16 model execution, E4M3 KV, Q8192 chunks, maximum length 262144, one live
request, prefix caching disabled, and `FULL_AND_PIECEWISE` CUDA graphs. It does
not enable speculative decoding or eager execution.

| Purpose | Prompt | Output policy | Decode intervals | TTFT | Prompt throughput | Decode result |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Quality | 16000 | natural EOS | 5 | 3.8562 s | 4149.15 tok/s | short observation only |
| Quality | 256000 | natural EOS | 15 | 102.7519 s | **2491.44 tok/s** | short observation only |
| Speed | 256000 | fixed 256 tokens | 255 | 102.9135 s | 2487.53 tok/s | **47.308 tok/s / 21.138 ms TPOT** |

Both natural-EOS retrieval and knowledge checks pass and both answers terminate
naturally. Their five- and fifteen-interval decode figures are deliberately not
reported as speed baselines. The fixed-length run supplies the qualified 256K
decode result; its post-EOS padding is not quality evidence. For the 256K
request, every TP rank records 480 Q8192 FP32-accumulated
long-prefill calls and 496 E4M3 bridge calls. The final route summary also
records 48 `decode_xqa_e4m3_dynamic_page800` calls per rank. The run contains
no prefix-cache hit, non-finite value, worker failure, or CUDA error.

The final source-built single-V100 Q8192 operator check reaches 77.0142 TFLOP/s
at KV128K and 75.9654 TFLOP/s at KV256K. Sampled output is finite, with relative L2
0.2387% and 0.2607%, respectively.

### Concurrent `vllm bench serve` Gate

The serving concurrency gate uses the same TP4 NVFP4 model and E4M3 KV route
above with `max_model_len=262144`, `max_num_batched_tokens=65536`,
`max_num_seqs=32`, prefix caching disabled, and normal
`FULL_AND_PIECEWISE` CUDA graphs. The benchmark is the standard
`vllm bench serve` random dataset with exact 2048-token inputs, 256 forced
output tokens, request rate infinity, one warmup cohort of the measured size,
and concurrency 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32. No run passes `--enforce-eager`.

Startup captures both full and piecewise graphs at request counts
`[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]`; the B32 capture records the page-800 E4M3 XQA route.
The previous no-MTP helper stopped full-graph capture at B16 even when
`max_num_seqs` was 32. It now includes B32 by default. Larger scheduler
capacities remain admitted and use the existing piecewise graph path rather
than losing the attention acceleration.

| Concurrency | Total input tokens | Median TTFT | TTFT-derived prefill* | Pure decode* | Steady ITL median/P90 | Full-request output TPS | Median request wall | Success/failure |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| C2 | 4,096 | 0.8554 s | 4,788 tok/s | 115.725 tok/s | 17.282 / 17.406 ms | 92.288 tok/s | 5.539 s | 2 / 0 |
| C4 | 8,192 | 1.6962 s | 4,830 tok/s | 223.730 tok/s | 17.879 / 18.038 ms | 151.222 tok/s | 6.761 s | 4 / 0 |
| C8 | 16,384 | 5.2214 s | 3,138 tok/s | 418.723 tok/s | 19.106 / 19.248 ms | 203.168 tok/s | 10.076 s | 8 / 0 |
| C16 | 32,768 | 10.7109 s | 3,059 tok/s | 708.450 tok/s | 22.585 / 22.837 ms | 248.859 tok/s | 16.451 s | 16 / 0 |
| C32 | 65,536 | 21.7727 s | 3,010 tok/s | **983.986 tok/s** | 32.521 / 32.824 ms | **272.868 tok/s** | 30.008 s | 32 / 0 |

`TTFT-derived prefill` follows the requested report convention:
total input tokens divided by median TTFT. `Pure decode` is concurrency times
1000 divided by the standard benchmark's pooled median ITL in milliseconds.
The full-request output TPS is the benchmark's measured generated-token
throughput and includes TTFT. These definitions keep the derived columns
reproducible and prevent a prefix-cache hit or a short decode sample from being
reported as prefill or decode throughput.

All 62 measured requests return exactly 256 tokens with no API errors,
non-finite timing samples, empty text, or replacement characters. A separate
32-request natural-language burst returns the identical complete answer
`校验词是“海蓝石榴”；太阳系最大的行星是木星。` for every request; all finish by
EOS rather than the 64-token cap.

The matching 256K CUDA-graph operator matrix verifies the attention route
independently of the short serving prompt:

| Batch | Scalar E4M3 | E4M3 XQA | Speedup | Max abs diff |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| B2 | 6.5542 ms | 1.8001 ms | 3.64x | `5.96e-8` |
| B4 | 12.1188 ms | 1.9790 ms | 6.12x | `4.77e-7` |
| B8 | 23.9122 ms | 3.7683 ms | 6.35x | `2.38e-7` |
| B16 | 47.6985 ms | 7.3877 ms | 6.46x | `4.77e-7` |
| B32 | 96.2947 ms | 14.6028 ms | 6.59x | `4.77e-7` |

Every operator output is finite. The native E4M3 batch-XQA admission has no
batch ceiling or total-KV-length ceiling; 64/128/256-token partitions and the
page-wave schedule are runtime choices after shape admission. The measured
specialization still requires the actual kernel contract: SM70,
Flash-Attention-V100, E4M3 KV, GQA6/D256, and no sliding window.

### Source-Build Identity

The CUDA 12.8, SM70 `build_ext --inplace` command completes successfully and
imports the following artifacts directly from this owned worktree:

- vLLM core: `2557f6b7b65773d9ed5f51c78eb7e7fed1ba83d05be473104e318bf8f88fa4c4`;
- stable libtorch: `622af59642e4ca861c1ae0561792fd3221f2d166d29f8bff0b0fb5b03b2ad162`;
- FA2/79T: `aa657e1624e40e102da8081d6deb57d92828aa129445a5506f4cb8a2d2eb5add`;
- Flash-V100: `66df783d9dfb783195bc9cae75d416731601f6a1095fba20d26bd7a8c10370b3`.

ELF dependencies resolve against the selected Torch 2.10.0 and CUDA 12.8
runtime. Process-map inspection confirms that the attention DSOs come from
this worktree rather than another checkout or an external sidecar.

### Runtime And Test Contract

The route is built from the same source tree as the vLLM core and Flash-V100
extension. Validation must record extension hashes and route counters. Future
end-to-end FP8-KV tests use normal CUDA graphs and must not pass
`--enforce-eager`. A 256K first-request run must report uncached prefill
separately from a prefix-cache hit; the cached request is not evidence for
prefill throughput.
