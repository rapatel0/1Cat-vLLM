# DFlash2 context-length cost audit, 2026-09-09

## Scope and frozen contract

Measure growth in complete verification-round cost at 64K and 128K, with a
same-prompt-template 1K anchor. The user stopped 256K measurements after observing
abnormally slow prefill; queued 256K jobs remain held. This is a latency
diagnostic, separate from the continuing natural-output quality campaign.
No production kernel, arithmetic, weights or serving default changes here.

The harness branch starts at main `80545c010bbf6f5ed06458d992c189d75d0eff8f`,
which contains optimization PR #556. The serving checkout remains frozen at
`a7cc5ae305149d7a9ffdf42fb224dff34e5606aa`, with the same native libraries as
the approximately 16-ms candidate. This avoids changing the runtime while
measuring context-length scaling. Target QUASAR/draft revisions are
`d8e6fbfa3e3a78899b440222b827430045a05b44` /
`dedf8df68adfb1afeaf7b7480c0a0243108177b4`.

Use physical GPUs 4–7, four V100-SXM2-32GB GPUs, TP4/B1/q8, CUDA 12.8,
Torch 2.10.0+cu128, Python 3.12.13, E4M3 target KV, FP32 logits/state and
FP16 draft transport. Preserve the fixed Gemma reduction, packed GDN,
BV2 value tile, combined split, QPN2 cap64/publication, grouped attention,
sparse selection, context/probe overlap and CUDA graphs. The server retains
262144 total context capacity, a 4096 prefill chunk budget and four maximum
request slots with only one live request.

The prompt uses the frozen long-context corpus's prefix, repeated filler and
coding-task suffix. Exact input lengths are 1024, 65536, 131072 and 261888
tokens. The last point reserves 256 tokens inside the 262144 capacity; it is
not a 262144-token input followed by out-of-capacity generation. Each diagnostic
request has at most 256 output tokens, honors EOS, and retains T1/k20/p.95/seed0
and the frozen xhigh template. Length stops receive no quality credit. Inputs
are never clipped, and all actual token counts are retained.

## Measurement and attribution

`benchmarks/profile_sm70_dflash2_context_cost.py` records an initial/warmup request
and three unprofiled repeats per input length. It separates TTFT, engine decode,
complete-round mean, emitted token throughput and draft acceptance, and retains
per-chunk token counts/times. Client stream intervals are transport evidence,
not instrumented GPU-round latency. No trace or tensor dump runs in this service.

`benchmarks/sm70_dflash2_context_trace.py` collects twelve q8 rounds in a separate
service after a warmup request and eight preceding q8 rounds. The gate rejects
prefill chunks, initial eight-token prefills, shorter tail queries and multiple
requests. Only capture boundaries synchronize. Every rank retains scheduled
width, computed positions and output positions; missing rank/window evidence
fails the client instead of producing a partial trace. The first and last
captured transitions are excluded from steady attribution.

The trace uses CUDA Graph node activity and NVTX with Nsight Systems 2025.3.1.
Attribute target graph, target head/sampling, state, draft and host work on the
same critical rank. Retain GPU event union and uncovered wall time separately.
Kernel service, phase envelopes and independent rank maxima must not be summed
as complete-round wall time. Static CTA/register/shared-memory evidence does
not establish achieved occupancy or HBM throughput.

## Validation and artifacts

CPU checks cover seven q8/prefill/tail/multiple-request combinations, four exact
prompt lengths and rejection beyond 262144 total tokens. Scoped pre-commit runs
on the benchmark modules. The first GPU observations below exposed a missing
native prefill dependency and do not qualify the intended fast route.

Artifacts, private launch wrappers, checkpoints and task-local compiler caches
are retained in the task artifact archive, with absolute locations in the
private handoff manifest. Generated libraries and private cache paths are not
part of this source change.
The dataset campaign is checkpointed, preserving completed same-startup pairs
and retaining any interrupted partial case separately. Its queued continuation
remains held during the prefill route investigation.

## Missing native prefill dependency

The frozen service selected `FLASH_ATTN_V100`, but its `lib-v4` dependency set
did not contain FA2 and its launch did not set `VLLM_SM70_FA2_D256_LIBRARY`.
The startup log explicitly warned that
`_vllm_fa2_C::sm70_d256_splitd_n32_dense_fwd` was absent and long prefill would
use a slower fallback. The E4M3 bridge is resolved from that same missing
library, so it was unavailable too. The later logs show direct paged E4M3
prefix prefill, without the D256/v37 bridge route.

The warning was missed before the long sweep. The partial unprofiled results
are retained as fallback observations, not expected Flash-V100 scaling:

| Input tokens | Complete round, ms | Pure decode, tokens/s | Accepted drafts/round | Emitted tokens/round | Initial TTFT, s |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1024 | 16.419 | 254.61 | 3.2295 | 4.1967 | 1.650 |
| 65536 | 34.972 | 142.97 | 4.0784 | 5.0196 | 81.468 |
| 131072 | 53.575 | 80.67 | 3.3390 | 4.3390 | 221.823 |

Round/decode values are medians of three repeats in one startup. All 12
completed requests reached the 256-output-token diagnostic cap; none receives
quality credit. Repeated token IDs and acceptance match within each length.
The initial 128K request could reuse the previous 64K prefix, so its TTFT is
not a cold-prefill measurement. Repeat TTFT also includes prefix-cache hits.
No 256K request completed and no graph-node trace was collected in this run.

PR #548 is already merged at `8d9c3518992059105d89939e8a46d75184505d8e`.
Its CMake-built FA2 library, SHA256
`ec00745c34b3d146b0200fb9454c1419322072b0ccf0d551d958cbe701e4e15b`,
contains Split-D dense/paged, v37 and the E4M3 bridge. Its eight v37 source
hashes match the frozen serving source. A private copy is frozen under this
audit's `native/fa2-ec00745c` directory; every other native dependency stays
fixed. This is a dependency-loading repair for the diagnostic service, not a
new kernel or a quality promotion. PR #548 disclosed a remaining model token
divergence; operator accuracy alone cannot close that model-quality gate.

The corrected launch explicitly selects this sidecar. The client checks native
availability and the loaded FA2 SHA on every rank before long requests, then
requires actual exact-bridge route hits. Snapshots occur between requests.
It resets the prefix cache before each new input length and requires the
request's computed-prefill-token counter to equal the full input length;
an HTTP reset response alone does not prove a cold request. Full API usage,
engine prefill time and computed-token metrics are retained. The first focused
repair run stops at 128K; 256K jobs must not resume automatically.

Missing FA2 explains the prefill fallback. It does not by itself attribute
the q8 decode slope: target verification has a separate grouped E4M3 FP32
dispatch and still needs a same-route graph-node trace after this repair.

## Repaired native-prefill probe

The explicit sidecar launch completed 16 requests through 128K using harness
commit `77ae71b0060acee63881204c4668aae1fe5e3406`. All four ranks mapped the
same FA2 SHA. Every cold request's computed-prefill-token count equals its
full input length. The 32K/64K/128K requests recorded respectively 144/304/624
v37 and exact E4M3 bridge calls per rank. Existing GPU attention/bridge tests
passed 23 cases, with both 256K cases deselected. The first test launcher
imported the unbuilt harness checkout and failed before GPU validation;
the rerun used frozen serving imports with explicit pytest import isolation.

| Input tokens | Cold prefill, s | Cold prefill, tokens/s | Complete round, ms | Pure decode, tokens/s | Accepted drafts/round | Emitted tokens/round |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1024 | 0.318 | 3222 | 16.429 | 287.43 | 3.7778 | 4.7407 |
| 32768 | 9.670 | 3388 | 25.606 | 168.79 | 3.3729 | 4.3390 |
| 65536 | 21.166 | 3096 | 34.730 | 143.97 | 4.0784 | 5.0196 |
| 131072 | 49.842 | 2630 | 52.981 | 85.95 | 3.5536 | 4.5714 |

Prefill is one verified cold request per length; round and decode are medians
of three warmed repeats in one startup. These are diagnosis results, not
the plan's three-startup performance acceptance. The 4096 chunk budget,
1648-token page, NVFP4 target and FP32 recurrent state are unchanged. Historical
FP8 target-only/chunk8192 results are a different contract.

All four requests at each length have identical output-token IDs and acceptance
within that startup. Compared with the missing-library fallback, the 64K
256-token output matches, while 1K and 128K first diverge at zero-based output
positions 114 and 21. None of these capped requests receives quality credit;
there is no promotion or claim that the sampled distribution is unchanged.
The repaired run retains FP32 arithmetic and does not disable compensation to
recover speed. Raw results and route snapshots are in
`results/context-cost-fa2-repaired.json`, with the compact comparison in
`results/prefill-repair-summary.json` under the audit artifact root.

## Historical prefill regression and precision gate

The requested historical numbers are real: PR #548's matched release run
records 128000 / 39.778778 = 3218 tokens/s and 256000 / 107.000216 = 2393
tokens/s. It uses an FP8 target without DFlash, chunk8192 and E4M3 KV.
PR #445 is the closer QUASAR NVFP4 + DFlash2 reference: 63482 input tokens
at 3596.5 tokens/s in the release wheel; same-host source observations at
63488 input tokens are 3611.8 and 3607.2 tokens/s. It uses chunk4096,
max_num_seqs4 and E5M2 KV. The repaired E4M3 run above is not declared to have
recovered historical prefill performance.

The launch also explicitly sets `FLASH_QLA_SM70_USE_ORIGINAL_TILELANG=0`,
overriding the default original FlashQLA prefill route. This has a recorded
precedent in PR #477's migration worklog, where restoring the original
TileLang route recovered prefill throughput. A bounded late-128K trace
confirms the current native VLK GDN costs 210.862 ms per 3296-token chunk
(48 calls). The actual launch is 96 CTAs, 64 threads/CTA and 79 registers
per thread; an earlier commentary incorrectly inferred 48 CTAs from another
block-group configuration. The trace, not that inference, is authoritative.

The same trace measures 665.067 ms of attention including its softmax
reduction, about 472.304 ms of remaining dense GEMM/reduction work,
114.835 ms of communication, and 35.103 ms of normalization/residual work
per rank/chunk. These are instrumented GPU service categories, not additive
end-to-end performance predictions. Critical-rank interval is 1562.795 ms,
GPU event union 1549.213 ms and uncovered time 13.582 ms. The four-rank
observations cover four real 3296-token prefills starting at positions
115360, 118656, 121952 and 125248; the middle two chunks are analyzed.

A native-versus-original GDN screen confirms 4.819 versus 0.832 ms at the
real TP4 Q4/Hv12/D128/T3296 shape. However, an independent FP64 recurrent
reference finds larger original-TileLang errors: at T65 with weak decay,
output relative L2 is 0.04661% versus native 0.02074%, and state relative L2
is 0.03610% versus native 0.0001018%. The T129 strong-decay case has the same
direction. The initial strict non-worsening reference gate therefore rejected
this arithmetic candidate. The user subsequently accepted output error growth
below one order of magnitude and explicitly requested measuring the historical
GDN fast route first. Output error is about 2x in this operator screen; state
error has a much larger ratio against the very small native FP32 error, so
state and model-quality conclusions remain separate from speed restoration.

The next candidate changes the number of value columns assigned to each
thread subgroup in the existing FP32 recurrence. It preserves the 16-lane
reductions, recurrence order, FP16 output boundary and FP32 state. The private
screen requires native output and state to be bitwise equal before timing a
candidate; no arithmetic downgrade is enabled. Raw artifacts are
`results/flashqla-original-operator.json` and `results/fp32-gdn-cols.json`.

The completed 64K q8 trace separately identifies target grouped attention as
the largest decode term: 18.798 ms of GPU service per rank/round, of which
18.471 ms is the compensated partial kernel. Its launch has 240 CTAs,
256 threads, 234 registers/thread and 30464 bytes of shared memory. These
static resources do not establish measured occupancy or memory bandwidth.
The standalone 128K q8 trace is held while prefill recovery takes priority;
the 256K jobs remain held at the user's direction.

## Restored original-GDN prefill measurements

The same serving source and FA2 sidecar were rerun with
`VLLM_SM70_FLASHQLA_ORIGINAL_PREFILL=1` and
`FLASH_QLA_SM70_USE_ORIGINAL_TILELANG=1`, removing the task launch's forced
serial-prefill override. The worker log confirms the original TileLang GDN
route with direct output and non-indexed state; FA2 bridge hits are recorded
on all four ranks. The native libraries, TP4/B1/q8, 4096 chunk budget,
262144 total capacity, E4M3 KV, FP32 logits/state, weights and sampling remain
fixed. No profiler or tensor dump is enabled.

| Input tokens | Previous cold prefill, tokens/s | Restored cold prefill, tokens/s | Restored cold prefill, s | Throughput gain | Complete round, ms | Pure decode, tokens/s | Accepted drafts/round | Emitted tokens/round |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1024 | 3222 | 3595 | 0.285 | 11.6% | 16.214 | 291.24 | 3.7778 | 4.7407 |
| 32768 | 3388 | 4070 | 8.051 | 20.1% | 26.068 | 148.21 | 2.8939 | 3.8788 |
| 65536 | 3096 | 3651 | 17.949 | 17.9% | 34.633 | 139.84 | 3.8627 | 4.8627 |
| 131072 | 2630 | 3015 | 43.476 | 14.6% | 53.133 | 81.34 | 3.3390 | 4.3390 |

Each prefill value is a verified cold request with the computed-token counter
equal to the full input length. Round/decode/acceptance values are medians of
three repeats in one startup. This recovers the approximately 3600 tokens/s
64K QUASAR result and 3000+ tokens/s at 128K. It is a speed diagnostic, not
the plan's three-startup acceptance or a prediction for 256K.

Within each length, all four requests have identical token IDs. Compared with
the serial GDN baseline, 1K is identical; 32K/64K/128K first differ at output
indices 199/126/21. The restored 64K request ends naturally after 248 tokens
with a complete Python function, whereas the control reaches the 256-token
cap inside its return expression. The other restored lengths hit the cap.
There is no claim of general quality parity from these bounded requests.
Accepted drafts/round at 32K/64K/128K change from 3.3729/4.0784/3.5536 to
2.8939/3.8627/3.3390. Different sampled continuations are a confounder, but
these observations do not establish acceptance-length non-inferiority.
Long-context decode is therefore not reported as recovered by this prefill
configuration change.

The route snapshot now records both original-GDN flags and their resolved
selection, plus indexed-state/direct-output settings. The optional
`--require-original-gdn-prefill` guard, used with `--require-native-prefill`,
rejects a forced serial GDN launch before long measurements. These are
configuration checks; the actual original-GDN hit must still be confirmed in
the worker log. This guard was added after the above run, not retroactively
claimed as part of its launch.

Retained reports are `results/context-cost-prefill-restored.json`,
`results/prefill-restored-summary.json` and the per-rank runtime-library
manifest. Job `zz3189-prefill-restored` completed successfully and its owned
service was stopped. The explicit fast-route launch is retained for subsequent
verification-cost work; queued 256K requests remain held.

The precision-preserving alternatives are also retained: value-column
scheduling passes 48/48 native output/state bitwise comparisons and lowers
the T3296 exp-gate operator from 4.842 to 3.271 ms. A four-token input prefetch
preserving recurrence order also passes 48/48 and reaches 2.696 ms. Increasing
prefetch to eight passes 12/12 but regresses to 5.698 ms, so it is rejected
without a model run. These are operator results, not end-to-end gains or
enabled production paths.
